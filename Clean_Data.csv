SUMM,company,"Our mission: Fostering inclusion by accelerating easy language adoption – making information universally accessible to everyone independent of cognitive abilities, education or linguistic proficiency.

Picture this: You probably look at stairs and recognize them as a convenient way to get to an elevated place. A physically impaired person, on the other hand, sees a huge barrier! And you probably read the news or company websites and get information out of them – but just as the stairs, their complexity can be a barrier – this time, a barrier to information.

For mentally handicapped, elderly or sick people, people with learning difficulties, or learners of a new language, a complex text can completely exclude them from information, because they simply can’t understand it. And with an ever increasing amount of information provided online, it is crucial to make it accessible to everyone. In Germany, over 10 million people rely on information being available in easy language – a style of language that follows specific patterns that make its structure and use of words easier to comprehend.

We are building the first AI-powered tool that automatically turns any text into easy language, fostering inclusion and breaking down information barriers at supersonic speed! We enable a variety of improvements:

- Translation agencies can increase their productivity by over 85% with our tool proposing a first translation they can build upon
- We support the public sector to comply with the barrier-free information technology (BITV) law by providing a tool to enable fast translation of new content
- We provide companies with an easy and convenient tool to communicate with customers in simple, understandable terms, e.g. for customer service, product descriptions, or terms of use

Contester is built to drive sales but eCommerce isn't only about short-term sales: 
- It improves customer experience to make more confident purchase decisions resulting in fewer returning items and less customer support. 
- It helps brands to reduce customer acquisition costs with cookieless personalization. 
- It helps marketing teams to get a higher return on content marketing and influencer partnerships. 
- And finally, the enhanced shopping experience improves brand loyalty and CLV in long term.

At others, it feels impossible to get things done. No one has an overview of all the software tools being used, the running costs and the data being exposed. People lose sight of the operational process and everyone starts pulling in different direction – or stop pulling at all.

We started Oveo because we believe employees should have easy access to all the SaaS tools they love and need, but with IT management simultaneously having peace of mind and seamless visibility into company-wide technology cost, utilisation and compliance risks. 

Today, our cloud-based SaaS Management platform help companies streamline their technology operations, boost productivity, employee engagement and enable any company in any industry to succeed as a SaaS-powered workplace.

In fact, Wasteless more than halves waste in food retail, and increases the revenues through markdown optimization. Minimizing Food Waste is one of the most impactful measures against climate change, according to Drawdown.org. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 70GTon over the next 30 years. Since supermarket waste is around 5% of total emissions, we're in the area that can have an effect of some 3GT reduced green house gas emissions ! 

For supermarkets, it's also a highly lucrative opportunity. BCG found that reducing food waste by supply chain optimization, and in particular dynamic pricing, is a global €100 Billion opportunity. Refed found that for US grocery retailers, food waste represents an $18.2 billion opportunity. On average, the value of wasted food in retail is equal to roughly double the profits from food sales.

Hokodo,company,"At Hokodo, we are modernising the way businesses buy from each other by making it easier and safer to sell to business customers! 

Our “Trade credit as a service” technology empowers B2B merchants to offer credit terms to their business customers instantly, even on their first purchase. In turn, customers benefit from additional payment terms through a frictionless checkout experience.

Over 30% of B2B trade takes place on credit terms, with trade credit representing the largest source of business financing in advanced economies. Yet current processes for offering trade credit are outdated and not fit for the digital age. Hokodo’s digital platform solves these issues by offering merchants a powerful set of solutions to manage trade credit and scale with confidence. Merchants that integrate with Hokodo see on average a 40% increase in revenues. 

Gone are the days of paper-based trading account applications, manual credit decisions and cumbersome sales journeys. Our easy-to-integrate digital platform streamlines the entire order-to-cash process, allowing merchants to make credit decisions in real-time, be protected against bad debt and get access to working capital finance options. We also protect merchants by insuring against the credit risk with Lloyd’s of London, and arrange the financing with our partners so our sellers can get paid upfront if they choose.

We’ve believed for a long time that the design and distribution of financial products has been broken, and we’ve been on a journey to fix it since. Our team cuts across geographical barriers and brings together financial services practitioners, engineers, data scientists and designers… all working together to create a better way of doing business!

Our team is ambitious, we work hard to make our goals a reality... and we still have fun! Want to join us on our journey? Drop us an email at jobs@hokodo.co

LIQUIDLOOP GmbH,company,"For cutting edge research in electrocatalysis.

Due to its outstanding time-resolution, pretreatment-free Product-to-Gas PoGASi interface, and modular design, LiquidLoop meets the challenging requirements for liquid and gas analysis for real-time monitoring of electro-catalytic reactions and processes.
The PoGASi allows the expansion and application of partial pressure mass spectrometers (MS), by granting a direct separation and consequent MS analysis of liquid and gas from any liquid carrier solution. A dedicated liquid inlet module is assembled on a pre-stage vacuum chamber before introducing to any MS system. 

The real-time analysis technology facilitates the access of MS analysis for fluids, which is otherwise nearly impossible. Our solution is ideal for laboratory analysis (electrochemistry) or process control in various industries.

Was macht agrimand aber so besonders? Wir bieten Landwirten, Händlern und Verarbeitern den ersten unabhängigen, neutralen und digitalen Ausschreibungsservice - und alles ist so einfach wie Online-Banking.

Was hat uns zu dieser Idee bewogen? Als Branchenkenner war uns der Wandel des Agrarhandels schon lange bewusst. Hatten Landwirte früher nur ein bis zwei regionale Verhandlungspartner bei denen es oftmals nach dem Prinzip: „Beziehung baut vor Preis“ ging, hat sich dieses Bild mit den Jahren geändert. Mussten früher noch Angebote direkt händisch verglichen werden, ist die neue Generation auf den Höfen mit Portalen wie Check24, Amazon oder Ebay aufgewachsen. Transparente und vergleichbare Preise sind heute wichtiger denn je. Landwirte wollen unabhängig sein. Dennoch gibt es hier bislang kaum digitale Möglichkeiten, Preise zu vergleichen. Dabei ist die Landtechnik als Vorreiter schon lange vernetzt und digitalisiert. Smart Farming, Precision Farming – all das ist uns längst kein Fremdwort mehr. Der Landhandel hinkt hier deutlich hinterher. Hier schließen wir mit agrimand die Lücke und leisten einen wichtigen Beitrag hin zu einer vernetzten Landwirtschaft und zum digitalen Landhandel.

Technological innovation focuses on a combination of active and passive cleanup technologies for rivers that prevent waste from entering the oceans. Due to their functional architecture, the stationary platform systems continuously take up and store waste drifting with the current. The flexible and AI-supported garbage collection boats are able to clean up waste hotspots in the larger environment - even in places that are difficult to access. The waste is then recycled by mechanical, thermochemical and biotechnological processes to new products.

Ecological Inspiration comprises raising public awareness for the global plastic crisis and promoting solutions through environmental education, interactive events and creative PR activities with international outreach.

However, the security and compliance burden has also increased, as has the complexity that comes with most power, choice and responsibility.

As podcasters, we were quite frustrated with how hard it is to be heard and find an audience who cares - and we are not the only ones. We believe there are many talented storytellers out there who simply do not get the attention they deserve. It shouldn’t take a big media house or name behind your podcast, to get on top of the charts. At the same time, we want to give all listeners and podcast enthousiast the opportunity to discover stories and people based on the actual content and not just podcast title and description. Because books shouldn’t only be judged by their cover!

That is why we are building RecTag
Our AI enables content based discovery beyond simple chart lists. We use elements of social networking so you can connect to fans, that truly care about the hard work you put into your content. Furthermore, we want listeners to have a personal connection to their favorite podcasters.

Why we love Podcasting
Compared to its visual counterpart video, audio content carries a much greater emotional impact. Put differently, conveyed through a podcast, a story gets directly into the listeners’ ear and draws a picture in their heads. It taps into an audience’s active imagination and creates a much more intimate connection.
Famous comedian and host of the “WTF with Marc Maron” podcast Marc Maron put it this way:

GOENOMICS GmbH,company,"GOENOMICS provides genome annotations to help agriculture, biotech and academia to develop and better understand genomic traits for improved plants and fungi. Improving plants is important to secure worldwide food supply, by optimising for example heat resistance and resistance against nutrient and water scarcity, and agricultural pests. Better understanding fungal biology is important to treat agricultural diseases and to improve fungi for industrial drug production or waste management. The term genome annotation summarises all steps with which each of the nucleotides of a genome sequence is given an explanation. Genome annotations are done in two steps: In the first step, all regions are identified that might have functional importance for the organism. In the second step, each of the identified regions is assigned a putative function, which is derived by comparing the region against knowledge from many databases and literature. Genome annotations provide the base for all downstream experiments like breeding, genetics, genomics, and proteomics. By delivering high quality data, GOENOMICS enables customers to avoid needless, meaningless and unsuccessful experiments and therefore to save money.

Now, new technology is allowing millions to benefit from genetic testing for diagnosis, while at the same time targeted therapies for previously untreatable disorders are being developed.

But the last step in genetic testing – interpreting mutations – remains laborious and costly. It can take a genetic testing lab weeks to interpret data from a single patient. Because of limited understanding of the consequences of mutations, the test results are often inconclusive and leave 70% of people undergoing a genetic test without diagnosis.

Cold-sense,service_provider,"We are a high-tech company making new and existing cold rooms more energy efficient, safer and environmentally friendly.

The challenge:
Heat exchangers in cold rooms operate below the freezing point of water and are prone to frost buildup - just like in a refrigerator or freezer. Frost formation leads to increased power consumption and reduced cooling capacity. Heat exchangers therefore need to be defrosted regularly. 

Our solution:
We develop customized and intelligent system solutions to prevent ice formation as well as to start the defrosting process automatically and adapting it to the complex logistical processes of the costumers. To do this, we equip cold rooms with our innovative ice sensor technology and provide monitoring and data analysis of the entire room.

The combination of our precise sensor technology with artificial intelligence allows an automated, safe and efficient control of the cold warehouse. Our solutions also reduce the footprint of one of the largest electricity consumers in the world: Process and space cooling.

About us:
We are a customer-focused, high-tech company with the mission to develop innovative, reliable, and robust system solutions to optimize technical equipment in cold and icing environments. Our long-term goal is to become the largest partner in Europe in the field of energetic efficiency of cold rooms.

APPBOOKs sind „lebendige Bücher“, die auch nach dem Kauf/Download und während der Nutzung/Abonnement jederzeit aktualisiert werden können. Dies ist nachhaltig und soll zum Schutz vor Abholzung das Publizieren von Printpublikationen verringern. Darum eignen sich APPBOOKs auch besonders gut für Fach-, Sach-, Schul-, Reise- und Ratgeberliteratur – aber auch für Belletristik und für Unternehmensliteratur.

Keine vergleichbaren Medien, wie Printbücher, E-Books oder ähnliche Wettbewerbslösungen, verfügen über dieses Spektrum an zukunftsweisenden Buchinnovationen und Vermarktungslösungen!

INNOLIBRO bietet gleichermaßen Lesenden, Verlagen, Autoren, Werbetreibenden und Resellern mit APPBOOKs ein ganzheitliches, modernes Medium basierend auf einer mächtigen Publishingplattform.

INNOLIBRO macht Lesen neu!

Darüber hinaus bieten wir diverse Jobs & Stellenangebote zur Erweiterung unseres Teams, weitere Informationen hierzu auf:

So können die hohe Rehospitalisierungsrate im Bereich der F-Diagnosen reduziert, komplexere Folgebehandlungen vermieden sowie individuelles Leid und Kosten für die Gesellschaft verringert werden. Die mentalis Nachsorge knüpft nahtlos an die Krankenhausbehandlung an, da sie technisch und prozessual in den Entlassprozess der Krankenhäuser integriert ist.

Kymera Labs invites you to join the synthetic data revolution – newly generated data that scales the peaks that data anonymization failed to reach.

What is synthetic data? It’s entirely new data based on real data. While the real data is kept secure and used only for specific necessary purposes, the synthetic data can be utilized for every other possible use case. Crucially, synthetic data maintains the statistical quality and data features of the original information, while being free from privacy and sharing limitations. The possibilities are endless.

Founded in Israel, Kymera Labs is a privately-held company that was formed to answer a single challenging question: how can sensitive data be simultaneously secure and unlocked?

The solution is Kymera’s groundbreaking Synthetic Data Fabrication Software, which generates brand new data that mimics the real data in every way. This synthetic data can then be used in every case where previously only the real, sensitive data would do – such as training AI/ML models, improving data management processes, developing POCs, and more.

Wirelane,corporate,"Wirelane ist ein zukunftsorientierter Full Service Provider und bewegt die Zukunft der Elektromobilität – Zuverlässige Hardware trifft smarte Software.
Die Firma ist aktuell in 5 Ländern (D, F, S, NL, CH) aktiv und hat Erfahrung mit großen Industriekunden (VW, Vattenfall, Bouygues u.a.) und ist in Europa einer der führenden Spezialanbieter für Hardware, Software und App-Lösungen im Bereich Elektromobilität. Wirelane bietet die Gesamtlösung als Software-as-a-Service („SaaS“) für B2C Endkunden und B2B Elektromobilitätsanbieter jeder Art. Drei Bereiche werden dabei optimal miteinander verbunden:  Hardware, Backoffice und Zugangsmedium (App & RFID Token).

Constantin Schwaab, der seit der ersten Stunde selbst überzeugter Elektromobilist ist, gründete gemeinsam mit einem motivierten Team im April 2016 die Firma Wirelane GmbH. Aktuell arbeiten an den 3 Standorten Saarbrücken, Berlin und München insgesamt 30 Mitarbeiter für eine saubere Zukunft.
Neben der Steuerung und Verwaltung von Ladesäulen entwickelte das Unternehmen eine neue High-Tech-Ladesäule für den privaten wie öffentlichen Bereich. Diese macht den Ladevorgang noch schneller und unkomplizierter als herkömmliche Ladesäulen. Die Wirelane-App erlaubt Zugriff auf 60.000 Ladepunkte in ganz Europa. Knapp 6.000 Ladepunkte nutzen bereits die Wirelane-Software für sämtliche nachgelagerten Abrechnungsvorgänge. Gemeinsam mit Wirecard wurde erstmals ein Zahlvorgang entwickelt, der es ermöglicht, den Ladevorgang per kontaktloser Kreditkartenzahlung (Tap Payment) zu steuern und abzuwickeln. Darüber hinaus konnte demonstriert werden, dass Blockchain basierte dezentrale Bezahlvorgänge über ein in unserer App integriertes Ethereum-Wallet möglich sind.

Staiy’s overarching mission is to accelerate the transition towards sustainable fashion, restoring timeless values by implementing the latest tools. Innovative technologies, materials, concepts and production practices meet in a contemporary platform that reflects the modern consumer.

The solution we have studied is a solution with a very low environmental impact, modular and able to adapt to each watercourse. In the study of this project, physical simulation tests were carried out using software and prototypes were made and tested to verify their functionality.

The RIVER CLEANING system, through the rotating movement of special floating devices anchored to the bottom and their particular transversal arrangement with respect to the course of the river, conveys all the floating waste in transit to a single point, where a collection system can then be positioned.

Why Dermatology?
Dermatologic diseases are the 4th most common cause of all human illnesses.
Every individual experiences a skin disease at least once during their lifetime.
7 of the 15 best selling drugs are used in dermatology already today and many more promising treatments are in the pipeline.

Conventional Diagnostics 
... based on clinical view and histopathology are imprecise and impede the optimal use of the already available highly specific modern therapies in dermatology.

With the approach of direct AI trading, Sub Capitals takes over the entire portfolio management of private investors, who previously had difficulties to invest in the financial markets due to lack of time or expertise and only achieved low returns. Our approach can be compared to autonomous driving or in this case autonomous investing, where private investors can take their hands off the wheel or portfolio and leave both the placing of orders and the analysis processes to the AI. We call this Neo Investing, which creates more equality on the financial markets for all individuals through fair access to our AI.

Our beliefs:
The world is changing in so many different phases, most of them in pursuit of a better life together. We see too little of these changes in the global financial markets. It is time to demand more equality and a fairer approach to technological change. Our mission ""democratize AI for private investors on the financial market"". This is not just about access for all, but rather about fair prices and the possibility of using AI for a good cause. With our business we want to be part of the worldwide equal rights movement, which should also give everyone the same chances for financial equality. We are convinced that with the right will and a self-reinforcing and complementary network, this mission can be pursued, and we can approach global equality in small steps. Hence our motto: Enabling equality through Neo Investing.",2-10,9.0,seed,0.8K,2021.0,False,False,False,0.0,,operational,2022-09-08 00:55:25,2021-07-20 06:22:10,107516.0,0,2022-02-03 07:46:32,4,718,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,Rejected

Neben den klassischen technischen Features für die Nutzeridentifizierung und Abrechnung haben wir ein integriertes, cloudbasiertes Lastmanagement umgesetzt, welches auf Wunsch auch die dynamische Steuerung zulässt.

Wir arbeiten technisch völlig unabhängig und sind somit in der Lage jede Ladeinfrastruktur, die mittels OCPP Standard kommunizieren kann innerhalb kürzester Zeit einzubinden.

Unser Highlight bildet die Wartungs-App für Ihr Servicepersonal. Hier wird auf Wunsch des Kunden der Installateur oder ein technischer Beauftragter über den Status der Ladeinfrastruktur informiert und kann im Falle einer Störung sofort eingreifen.

Neben dem klassischen Backendbetrieb bieten wir innerhalb Ihrer Projekte auch an, den kompletten Betrieb Ihrer Ladeinfrastruktur ganz oder teilweise zu übernehmen. Hierzu zählt der technische Betrieb, die Service Hotline, das Monitoring, das Nutzermanagement, die Abrechnung und die kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung der besten Ideen und Vorschläge unserer Kunden. 

Stellen Sie sich einmal vor, dass Sie beispielsweise Ihr Quartier mit Ladesäulen ausstatten und Ihren Mietern das Laden mittels einer RFID Authentifizierung ermöglichen wollen. Auch öffentliches Laden soll möglich sein für Besucher. Nachdem wir gemeinsam die notwendigen Daten zum Betrieb definiert haben, ist es problemlos möglich, dass Ihre Mieter von uns direkt mit der notwendigen Ladekarte versorgt werden und die Abrechnungsprozesse automatisiert abgewickelt werden. Abgerechnet wird direkt nach dem Ladevorgang, ohne Risiko für Sie als Vermieter. Damit Sie nicht jeden Ladevorgang einzeln verbuchen müssen, erhalten Sie von uns am Monatsende die Gesamtabrechnung und Auszahlung der Umsätze.

Nitrobox,company,"Nitrobox Finance Platform is an enterprise-grade cloud software for automating and managing sophisticated monetization models: transactional, recurring, usage based or any hybrid model.   Nitrobox provides all capabilities within one single platform, made for building and running complex payment billing and accounting processes of digital business models. The state-of-the art technology is fast, easy to integrate, reliable and secure.   Based in Hamburg and Cracow, Nitrobox operates on a global level and collaborates with clients from more than 80 countries around the world.    Corporates – such as automotive manufacturers – develop new digital business models as part of their digital transformation. Every business model requires the development of highly complex financial processes such as the management of digital payments, international invoicing or the management of subscriptions and contracts. Conventional accounting and billing systems were not made for today’s increasingly complex digital businesses.   But challenging the status quo is part of our company DNA, so in 2016 we decided to push the boundaries of what’s possible when it comes to monetizing digital products at speed.  With Nitrobox, companies are able to monetize new and digital business models more quickly and easily than with traditional software systems, by providing a software-as-a-service platform for the creation, automation and API control of their financial processes in an integrated system. Business logic and processes can be easily adapted to meet individual requirements – for all business models, products or sales channels.

Flowfox,company,"All-in-one import automation platform

Transforming Ocean Carrier’s import departments into profit centers and simplifying business for their importing customers.

Challenges addressed by Flowfox:

Manual import processes
Manual processes done by unencrypted emails are insecure, produce a high workload, lead to errors as well as result in unnecessary costs, a lot of waiting time and lack of transparency for the Importing Party and the Ocean Carrier.

Missing & late data
Unknown drop-off depots and dates lead to poor equipment control and unnecessary empty repositioning. Additionally, terminals often are not aware of the next mode of transport and the pick-up date before the container discharge, leading to unnecessary costs.

Unused sales opportunities
Currently, import processes are simply being performed. Services are not available within the current process, leading to missed revenue opportunities.

Import Automation with Flowfox:

Container Release
Container releases can be fully automated and is the base for all further automation, cost savings and revenue generation. Real time container release and real time status visibility will be enabled to the Importing Party and dead freights are avoided.

Container Reuse
Reuses can be requested from the Importing Party and automatically processed.

Drop-off Change
Drop-off changes can be requested from the Importing Party and automatically processed.

C/H Instructions
For carriers haulage shipments the detailed instructions like place of delivery or delivery times can be queried and submitted through Flowfox.

Dem, Det & Storage
Contracts and rates can be managed. Individual fees can be calculated, displayed to the customer, invoiced and collected.

Data Generation
Valuable data can be generated to make the supply chain more efficient. The drop-off depot and date can reduce empty repositioning for the Ocean Carrier.

MUSKthrust GbR,company,"Take to the sky. Strive for greatness.  To Revolutionize Urban Mobility The history of urban mobility is strongly intertwined with the development of housing. For centuries we have succeeded in being able to support a growing number of passengers via an increasing number of transportation solutions, thus enabling us to increase the density of our cities, ultimately setting the foundation for our modern society. We strongly believe that we, to achieve the next step in this evolution, need to move into the third dimension. To achieve this goal we set out not just to create something capable of flight, but rather to create a product that is capable of bringing a premium experience to the consumer market.  To Revolutionize Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAV) It is our conviction that we can bring the freedom of personal air travel to the mass market. This goal was taken with the development of the first mass-produced car and has been pursued to this day in many ideas with varying degrees of success. However, none of these ideas have yet managed to achieve actual access to the mass market. For this reason, we are pursuing the goal of achieving not only further developments in our product but in every single step that comes before and after it.  To Revolutionize Industry The history of production is marked by several rapid upheavals that have fundamentally changed its face. Each of these upheavals has enabled humanity as a whole to advance into a new era of prosperity and freedom. It is now time for it to undergo fundamental change again. Our goal is to take 3D printing out of rapid prototyping and into mass production. This, in combination with a high degree of automation in production, enables us to achieve good cost efficiency in low production volumes. Also, our production can dynamically switch to new products and processes and incorporate modifications into existing products.

The CareVoice,company,"Driven by the purpose to make health insurance more human, we are a leading Asian health insurtech uniquely tackling 4 major health insurance pain points:
- Gap of customer engagement and health services
- Lack of differentiated insurance products, poorly customer centric
- Dependency on traditional sales channel, being unequipped to tap into the future of customer relationship
- Limited digital capabilities and integration challenges with ecosystem partners 

Through CareVoiceOS, the first healthcare operating system for insurers, we are expanding a “One Click” Connected Health Insurance Ecosystem. According to insurers’ maturity and technology investment, CareVoiceOS can be their turnkey solution, or become the new standard infrastructure to build their own customer engagement solutions. 

By partnering with us, insurers can enter the world of digital health insurance. They can effectively engage their customers with the latest health technologies and connected services, through an integrated customer journey experience that brings trust and health benefits. They can also design and launch tailored insurance products for specific populations, with relevant wellbeing & medical services and exclusive channels. 

Insurers can further benefit from our “sibling company” and strategic partner, StartupCare, a leading digital health insurance solution provider for employers and individuals, to drive further commercialization of these new health insurance products. 

Together this supports insurers unlock sales growth and optimizes the efficiency of their health insurance business. We operate in China Mainland & Hong Kong, and are expanding to Southeast Asia and Europe.

Forte,company,"We do not currently have a way to finance high-quality education, especially vocational reskilling, at the scale required. 

Forte (which stands for Financing Of Return To Employment) is a new, better way to invest in human potential. It is a way to finance reskilling at no cost to either individuals or governments, and without needing philanthropy.

Here’s where the idea for the Forte approach comes from: The cost of reskilling is often far less than the increase in government taxation revenue caused by that training. Forte utilizes this empirical reality by enabling education to be paid for with that increase in expected future tax.

In practice, it works in three simple steps:

1. Via the Forte platform, investors can pay for the vocational training of individuals who would otherwise be paying no or negligible tax.

2. This training, by its nature, increases expected employment, incomes, and therefore government tax revenue.

3. Governments, as part of the contractual arrangement, pass back to investors an agreed portion of the tax revenue attributable to the training recipients, for a set period of time.

By way of example, suppose Lydia just lost her job and wants to be a programmer in the future. With the Forte approach, an investor could finance a six-month coding training course to 1000 people like Lydia, in return for 30% of the tax revenue attributable to them for 5 years.

This arrangement is mutually beneficial.

Individuals receive training at no cost. They just pay the usual tax rate. They’re effectively paying for their own training with their future tax.

Governments can help workers have lost their jobs, prepare the workforce for the jobs of the future, overcome skill gaps, and prevent long-term unemployment, without worsening the budget. And there are mathematical ways to guarantee they bear no risk and never lose out.

Investors can both do good and do well. They can invest in a way that genuinely helps those in need.

Visitor Analytics,company,"Visitor Analytics is a high-performing start-up that aims to offer an all-in-one solution for any website in regards to website statistics, UX & behavior (recordings, heatmaps, funnels, etc.), visitor interaction, and so much more. Founded in January 2016 in Munich and Cluj, our app has been installed more than 2.5M times by users from 190 countries.

Tracking and understanding website statistics, analytics and user behavior using most tools is very complex & time-consuming, especially for non-technical people.

It’s easy to find yourself stuck in an overwhelming amount of graphs and charts. This is why we developed Visitor Analytics: all the tools you need, united into one app. A user-friendly structure, a straightforward presentation of complex data, and simplifying your work with  data synergy between modules!

We are 100% GDPR/CCPA compliant and collect all the data a website owner needs to know about their visitors in real-time: referrals, conversions, bounce rates, click paths, traffic structure, social media interactions, custom events, page visits, IPs, locations, browsers, devices or OS used, and much more. And get more value from the app by using our visitor behavior analysis tools: session recordings, conversion funnels, and heatmaps. Receive feedback from your website’s visitors with almost no effort using our amazing poll and survey features.

baseclick,company,"At baseclick we believe that bioconjugation is not just a method to connect (bio)molecules, but a tool to develop valuable applications. Simple methods for efficient and robust nucleic acid labeling are at the core of the baseclick technology.
Our mission is to develop and provide the best nucleic acid labeling applications and reagents for the life science market.
History
In 2008 BASF venture capital and Prof. Thomas Carell from the LMU Munich started to turn this mission into reality and founded baseclick GmbH, with its site close to Munich. Back then, it was very hard, using standard labeling techniques such as dye-building blocks, NHS-chemistry or other techniques to efficiently modify nucleic acids with multiple modifications. This was due to a lack of efficiency and simplicity in labeling technology. So, a new strategy was needed: click chemistry! Since then scientists at baseclick and elsewhere are improving the technology and widening its scope by creating inventive applications. Our expertise in this field has led to collaborations with leading companies and laboratories in pharma, life science and academia. But what about pricing and quality? Even a great technology should be offered in good quality at reasonable prices. Therefore, we have developed a high-quality affordable product portfolio on click chemistry-based applications to support your research.",11-50,11.0,early growth,0.5K,2008.0,False,False,False,1.2,1.2,operational,2022-08-18 20:30:55,2013-10-01 11:00:00,96793.0,0,2022-05-23 09:26:35,2,457,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Fibraworks produces with its winding process multi-layered, multi-directional semi-finished fiber products, like Organo-Coils or Tailored NCF, for cost-effective and sustainable lightweight solutions.

Flexible, material-independent and cost effective – our patented winding process permits, for the first time, the large-scale production of multi-directional semi-finished fiber products with a thermoplastic matrix, our so-called Organo-Coils, produced customer-specific and sustainably based on, e.g., natural-, glass- or carbon fibers. With our continuous and flexible production technology and minimization of downstream process steps we can attain outstanding cost efficiency that will accelerate the use of thermoplastic composites in lightweight construction in all industries.

We produce Organo-Coils based on UD-tapes that are wound and fixed into multidirectional layers. Our customers can select the arial weight and resulting fiber orientation within a wide range of options. We can generate fiber orientations between 30° and 70° that can be supplemented by 0° and 90° layers. The results are customer-specific bi-axial, tri-axial or quadraxial Organo-Coils. Due to their flexible fiber orientation, our Organo-Coils offer very high lightweight potential and superior cost efficiency. Our team consists of technology-savvy and innovation-driven experts from the fields of composites, special purpose machinery manufacturing, aeronautical engineering, and business administration. Our innovative winding process with its ultra-high-volume output rates facilitates the production of energy- and resource-efficient, recyclable products for sustainable and large-scale lightweight solutions.

valideffect,company,"We are a startup funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and RWTH Aachen University, developing a software platform that helps companies to digitally secure and manage personal industrial credentials.

For the further development of our app and our platform, we are continuously looking for initial pilot partners who would like to evaluate the software together with us.

If you are interested, simply contact us at founders@valideffect.de. 

Our solution:
Use our veripass app to digitally secure and manage your personal credentials.

Whether certificates or qualifications: With our veripass app, all your paper-based credentials are digitally available in one place at any time.

By digitizing paper-based credentials the effort required for credential management and credential audit (compliance) reduces by up to 40% - 90%. 

At the same time, the establishment of a technical trust and the use of additional security features via our platform helps to increase the reputation of the company. Another advantage is the use of our app in an industrial environment (hands-on approach).

Ideal for industrial companies and employees who want to reduce effort and thus costs in credential management and credential verification through a digital transformation.

Beezer,company,"Beezer is your all-in-one platform to create, distribute, and manage your own mobile app. Spread awareness, engage customers, and improve conversion with a Beezer-built Progressive Web App. 

Our platform allows Marketing Managers, Events' Organisers, Business Owners, and more to quickly and easily create their own Progressive Web App - without any coding or technical skills - by simply uploading their content.

Business is increasingly online, and “online” is increasingly mobile - businesses know this. But capitalizing on it can be hard. The web is no longer fit for purpose on mobile, which is why users spend 90% of their phone time in apps. But apps aren't much better: they cost a fortune to develop, and once that's done, they go into the app store...where, unless they're owned by Facebook or Google, they're unlikely to be downloaded or used.

At Beezer, we decided that there had to be a third way. And that's why we created a platform that puts the power back into the hands of small businesses. It's easy to use, it's affordable, and it empowers anyone to not only build, but also distribute, manage, engage with, and analyse their own PWA.

What are PWAs? Progressive Web Apps marry the best of the web – namely, discoverability, easy distribution without gatekeepers, and download-free access – together with the security, offline functionality, slick UX/UI, and tools of engagement normally seen in native apps. 

With a Beezer-built PWA, you get your own powerful mobile-first online presence - on your own terms.

Demzufolge befasst sich PARKLAB mit der Digitalisierung und Vernetzung von öffentlichen beziehungsweise privaten Parkflächen mithilfe der selbst entwickelten Parkplatzsensoren.
Die von den Sensoren gewonnenen Daten werden in Echtzeit an den Nutzer durch die neuzeitliche LoRaWAN Technologie weitergeleitet. Diese können den Fahrer beispielsweise durch die App auf dem Smartphone zum Zielort navigieren und die Parkgebühren mit dem Smartphone zahlen.

Neben Autofahrern bietet PARKLAB auch smarte Lösungen für Unternehmen, sowie Kommunen an, die mithilfe eines Dashboards Kunden bzw. Bürger bei der Parkplatzsuche begleiten können und dabei die Parkplatzsituation aktualisieren.

Mit seinem System trägt PARKLAB auch zum Klimaschutz bei. Mit der Smart Parking Lösung von PARKLAB wird der CO₂-Ausstoß, der bei Parkplatzsuche im Verkehr entsteht, reduziert. Zusätzlich bieten wir mehr Mobilität für Pendler sowie Reisende.

Durch die erfassten Daten wird in der Zukunft autonomes Parken besser mit der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und Automatisierung der Fahrzeuge, die vermehrt auf intelligente Systeme zurückgreifen, verknüpft.

Mit einem großen und vielfältigen Produktangebot kommt PARKLAB allen Bedürfnissen seiner Kunden nach. Neben Parkplatzsensoren bestehen noch weitere Sensortechniken und Softwareprogramme, die eigens von PARKLAB hergestellt wird und entwickelt wurde.

Compounder.eu,company,"Den passenden Studiengang auf der richtigen Hochschule schnell finden und sich ganz einfach und direkt dafür bewerben, ohne auf hunderten von Webseiten nach Informationen suchen zu müssen – das muss doch heutzutage möglich sein!

Diesen Gedanken hatten wir bereits im Jahr 2017, kurze Zeit nachdem wir als ehemalige Studienbewerber selbst Ewigkeiten gebraucht haben, bis wir uns für einen Studienplatz entschieden und uns anschließend an der Hochschule eingeschrieben haben. Es dauert einfach viel zu lange, bis man endlich herausgefunden hat, welche Dokumente wann, wo und auf welchem Weg rechtzeitig eingereicht werden müssen. Vor allem, wenn man sich nicht nur für einen Studiengang oder eine Hochschule, sondern für mehrere bewirbt. Nach Abschicken der Bewerbung fehlen dann teilweise noch einige Dokumente und müssen per Mail nachgereicht werden, was den gesamten Bewerbungs- und Einschreibeprozess noch langsamer macht. Nach einigen Gesprächen mit Freunden, die das gleiche Problem hatten, war eins klar: dieses Problem müssen wir lösen. So wurde Compounder® ins Leben gerufen.

Einige Zeit und Recherchearbeit später wurde deutlich, dass nicht nur auf Seite der Studieninteressenten, sondern auch auf Seite der Hochschulen etwas verändert werden muss, um den gesamten Prozess effizienter gestalten zu können. Gesagt, getan – In Zusammenarbeit mit Hochschulen haben wir eine Lösung erarbeitet, die es ermöglicht, jede einzelne in- und ausländische Bewerbung automatisch auf Vollständigkeit und Zulässigkeit für ein Studium in Deutschland zu prüfen.

So wollen wir mit Compounder® nicht nur jungen Studieninteressenten ermöglichen, sich auf moderne und einfache Art und Weise Studieninformationen zu beschaffen und sich auf direktem Wege für ihren Wunschstudienplatz zu bewerben, sondern Hochschulen auch Zeit und Arbeit im Bewerbermanagement abnehmen – und das alles auf nur einer Plattform.",2-10,4.0,seed,26K,2020.0,False,False,False,0.0,,operational,2022-08-30 01:19:12,2020-08-20 10:49:23,455351.0,0,2020-08-20 11:07:03,3,25628,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Wir sind große Fahrradfanatiker und nehmen, wenn möglich immer das Bike. Aus diesem Grund ist es uns wichtig dieses Problem zu lösen.

Eine unstylische Warnweste kommt für uns nicht infrage, weshalb wir Produkte entwickeln, die den urbanen Fahrradverkehr sicherer machen und dabei minimalistisch und cool aussehen! Emil und Jacob, unsere Gründer, verfolgen seid 2019 diese Mission. Mit der ersten Crowdfunting Kampagne haben wir über 20.000€ eingenommen und die erste Produktion finanziert. Nach der erfolgreichen Abwicklung haben wir durch das Investment der Wald und Wiese Holding um Tarek Müller, Nils Seebach und Alexander Graf den nächsten Schritt gemacht. Mittlerweile sind wir zu einem profitabel wachsendem Fashion eCommerce Start-Up geworden. Wir haben unser Team vergrößert und sind in ein Büro auf der Schanze in Hamburg gezogen.

Wir freuen uns als Team auf jede Challenge und sind absolute Teamplayer. Unsere Mission, den Straßenverkehr sicherer zu machen, wird von unserem Team gelebt und Erfolge sind immer Teamleistungen. In unserem Büro herrscht freundschaftliche Atmosphäre, über die sich auch von unsere ""Feelgood Managerin"" aka ""Office Dog"" Amelie jeden Tag freut.

Unsere Produkte werden durch unser freshes Marketing im Markt positioniert. Das Gesicht für unsere Kunden ist hierbei Jacob. Den Rücken kriegt Jacob durch das Marketing-Team gestärkt und wir sind immer offen für kreative und coole Kooperationen und Kampagnen.

Ability to share your shopping patterns with care managers for better care coordination to help decrease health risks and health care costs is another critical component to this solution. Lastly, Gian is poised to measure outcomes that will show how improved shopping carts leads to better health.

Triumf Health,company,"Triumf Health delivers digital therapeutics to children aged 7-14 through a mobile game to improve their mental wellbeing and quality of life. Our platform has two solutions: Triumf Hero for children with underlying chronic illness (cancer, diabetes, asthma, overweight/obesity and surgery) & Triumfland Saga for children with no physical health issues.  The onset of more than 50% of mental disorders happens during youth, which makes targeting prevention towards children and young people important. However, existing healthcare services fall short in their ability to prevent long-term negative impact on child and adolescent health. Consequently, only 1 in 4 children with mental health issues receives treatment at the moment.  Digital medicine is highly relevant when it comes to youth mental health in two fundamental aspects: detection of emerging mental illness and providing youth-friendly treatment.  Ou DTx platform combines psychosocial research, validated psychological techniques and data analytics to assess, monitor as well as support the mental health of children and induce the creation of healthy habits during gameplay. Unlike most other commercially available digital health solutions, the digital intervention is based on the Self-Determination Theory of motivation and behaviour change. Through a game environment, research-based content is delivered to educate, monitor and support children in a personalised manner.   We have successfully finished our first clinical trials in two hospitals in Estonia proving the effectiveness of the game among pediatric cancer patients. Our research findings are published in JMIR Serious Games (https://games.jmir.org/2019/3/e13776/).

Our technologies are the fruits of over 15 years of pioneering research and development at the Stem Cell Center in the Technion’s Rappaport Faculty of Medicine. 
Accellta was established in 2012 through a seed investment from the Alfred Mann Institute of the Technion. Our last investment round was led by Horizons Ventures.
We have already established several agreements with leading companies that manufacture, market and sell stem cells culture media, based on our rich Intellectual Property.

We are offering our partners the custom-made development of up-scalable, robust manufacturing of stem cells and designated media for regenerative medicine or drug screening purposes.

Serinus,company,"A lightning strike in the data center, flooding in your region, an emergency case in the production line – whenever the worst case scenario occurs, it is important to be prepared. Serinus has been specifically developed for this purpose.  According to a predefined set of rules, Serinus provides information and sends alarms using all available communication channels, notifies users about specific events and informs about any required responses.

The smart event communication platform is available in three editions to ensure efficient and reliable alarm and crisis management. The SaaS solution is operated regardless of the infrastructure. The on-premises version allows a full integration into the system landscape. The hybrid solution combines the benefits of the cloud and server-based solutions, while enabling a deep integration into the whole communication infrastructure.

To develop this alert, information and collaboration platform, the three founders were able to fall back on their combined experience of over 40 years in the fields of IT, telecommunications, security technology, as well as alarm and crisis management. Shortly after its foundation, Serinus became one of the world's leading providers in the field of Smart Event Communication.

Trailer Dynamics,company,"Trailer Dynamics entwickelt den Newton eTrailer, einen Sattelauflieger, der die Effizienz des Sattelzuges steigert und dadurch zum Vorteil für seine Nutzer und die Umwelt wird. Er reagiert eigenständig auf das Fahrverhalten seiner angekoppelten Zugmaschine und unterstützt sie mit Hilfe seines integrierten elektrischen Antriebsstrangs. Auf diese Weise sollen signifikante Treibstoffeinsparungen erzielt, der Schadstoffausstoß reduziert und insgesamt deutliche Kostensenkungen für die Nutzer erzielt werden. Zudem ist Newton mit adaptiven aerodynamischen Applikationen ausgestattet, die besonders bei Autobahnfahrten oder auf Landstraßen weitere Energieeinsparungen ermöglichen.

Der Newton eTrailer wird seinen Nutzern einen Wettbewerbsvorteil sichern.  Von geringeren Treibstoffkosten, geringeren Mautkosten und einer gesteigerten Fahrzeugperformance profitieren sowohl große Speditionen als auch kleine Unternehmen. Gleichzeitig reduzieren die Nutzer den Schadstoffausstoß ihrer Fahrzeugflotte, was der Natur zu Gute kommt und außerdem ein positives Image des Unternehmens fördert.

Trailer Dynamics treibt die Elektrifizierung des Straßentransports voran. Die e-Mobilität ist im Kurzstreckentransport bereits auf dem Vormarsch, jedoch fahren Sattelzüge weiterhin nahezu ausschließlich mit Dieselmaschinen und verursachen somit hohe Emissionen. Die e-Mobilitätskonzepte, die sich zurzeit im innerstädtischen Warentransport bewähren, lassen sich leider nicht einfach auf den Langstreckentransport ummünzen. Ein elektrisches Transportfahrzeug, das nur für die sogenannte letzte Meile der Transportstrecke von Waren eingesetzt wird, kann mit geringen Batteriekapazitäten und kurzen Reichweiten effizient betrieben werden. Ein Langstreckenfahrzeug würde jedoch enorme Batteriekapazitäten benötigen, die eine erhebliche Gewichtssteigerung und sehr hohe Anschaffungskosten bedeuten würden. 

Der Newton eTrailer ist die neue Lösung und der erste große Schritt für einen nachhaltigen Straßentransport",11-50,12.0,early growth,0.9K,2018.0,False,False,False,0.0,,operational,2022-08-24 04:53:39,2018-11-20 14:43:45,29784.0,1,2021-02-03 08:10:42,2,807,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Smart Forest,company,"For many years investing in the forest has been restricted to a narrow group of people. Just a few had enough resources to create their own plantations or buy shares in a forest fund. Nowadays with the development of new technologies any of us can become an investor and gain profits out of owned trees. 

Smart Forest makes investing in forest smart by decreasing the entry-level from a couple of thousands of euros to just a few, by selling singular trees from plantations. We efficiently scout the forestry market to select, the most profitable tree species, the best-growing conditions, and the most reliable planters, to ensure a fixed income from a tree. 

Smart Forest appeared in 2018 as a concept of an additional retirement plan. We believe that with the actual economic situation, it is hard to predict in 30 years perspective if expected pension will allow for a decent life. Long term investments in trees resolve this issue as trees grow constantly, even in the economic crisis outburst. 

Our mission for today is to allow you to make profitable investments with just a couple of clicks. To make your experience smooth and to provide you all the needed information for cognisant decision. 

We believe that having a profitable, tangible and sustainable investment tool as tokenized trees, can dramatically change the global economy. If planting trees can bring financial profits, the world soon can become greener and full of people confident about their secured financial future.

Additive Marking GmbH,company,"Die Additive Marking GmbH adressiert seit der Ausgründung aus der Universität Paderborn im Jahr 2018 die Herausforderung, additiv gefertigte Bauteile über den gesamten Produktlebenszyklus rückverfolgbar zu kennzeichnen.

Anwendungsfälle reichen von Ersatzteilen über Prüfkörper bis hin zu sicherheitskritischen und hochkomplexen Produkten. Ersatzteile, die bisher im Spritzguss o. Ä. gefertigt wurden und eine Markierung durch die Spritzgussform erhalten haben, werden zunehmend nach Verschleiß der Formen bei schwindender Nachfrage nach Bedarf im 3-D-Druck hergestellt. Prüfkörper sollten klar zur Positionierung und Orientierung in der additiven Fertigungsanlage zuzuordnen sein und für sicherheitskritische Bauteile beispielsweise in der Luft- und Raumfahrt, für medizinische Anwendungen oder im Automobilbau ist die Notwendigkeit einer Markierung zur Rückverfolgbarkeit selbstverständlich.
Rechtlich zielen derzeit viele Fragen auf die Anwendung Additiver Fertigungsverfahren ab. Produkt- und Produzentenhaftung getrieben durch die Besonderheiten in der Reproduzierbarkeit bestimmter Bauteil- und Materialeigenschaften werden neu diskutiert, so dass eine (noch fiktive) Schlagzeile der Zukunft so lauten könnte:

„Neue EU Richtlinie reguliert Pflichten bei der Nutzung Additiver Fertigungsverfahren: 
3-D gedruckte Produkte müssen zum Zwecke der Rückverfolgbarkeit gekennzeichnet werden.“

Wir sind ein junges (hessisch geführtes) Start-Up Unternehmen, das eine Nachhilfeplattform für die Vermittlung von Nachhilfelehrern und Schülern in Form einer App entwickelt hat. Neben der Tatsache, dass die Nachfrage nach einer solchen Plattform sehr hoch ist, möchten wir mit unserer App langfristig und nachhaltig die Nachhilfebranche in Deutschland digitalisieren und revolutionieren. 

Dies ermöglichen wir mithilfe eines innovativen und neuen Konzepts, welches auf einer schnellen, einfachen und vergleichbaren Vermittlung basiert.

Wie es dazu kam?

Als Physikstudent, Pizzabäcker, Biotechnologe, Designer und Weltreisender fanden wir uns kurzerhand in den Anfangszeiten der Corona Krise zusammen, um Brainlevel ins Leben zu rufen und die jetzige Situation zu entlasten. Wir alle arbeiteten stets täglich und von Zuhause aus an diesem Projekt, um schnellstmöglich auf den Markt gehen zu können.

Nun ein paar Erklärungen zur App:

Schüler können über verschiedenste Suchparameter nach Ihrem geeigneten Lehrer suchen oder per Sofort-Nachhilfe innerhalb weniger Minuten an Nachhilfe kommen. Und das super einfach mit dem Smartphone. Auf der anderen Seite können Lehrer relativ schnell und unkompliziert Geld verdienen und sich Erfahrung als Nachhilfelehrer aneignen - perfekt für die momentan chaotische Corona-Zeit! 

Um die App zu testen und damit der Schüler sich ein Bild vom Nachhilfelehrer machen kann, ist die erste Kennenlernstunde kostenlos.

Durch ein ausgeklügeltes Levelsystem profitieren jeweils Lehrer und Schüler. Lehrer werden mit steigendem Level mehr Schülern angezeigt und Schüler sparen ab einem bestimmten Level Geld. Mit weiteren Funktionen wie dem Kalender, einem Chat, Nachweisen und Feedback garantieren wir dem Nutzer alle Features, die er benötigt, verknüpft mit einem schönen und modernen Design.

Discovering new works, highlighting parts, referencing multi-part scores, navigating between movements, printing custom copies and even changing keys are all just a few taps away, and the app is full of intuitive little features that make working with sheet music a more streamlined experience.

Digitization is made possible by an advanced AI system that analyzes millions of static pages and critical findings to reconstruct a definitive digital version of each work. The Enote Library already contains thousands of scores, and dozens of new pieces are added to the library each week.

The release of our app is the first step in an exciting journey with the music community, and we have dozens of exciting new projects in the works that will impact the daily lives of millions of musicians worldwide.

Wasser ist wesentlicher Bestandteil unserer Zellen, ohne Flüssigkeit würden unsere Nieren nicht richtig arbeiten, unsere Muskeln nicht funktionieren und unser Gehirn könnte nicht die erforderliche Leistung erbringen. Auch ist Wasser ein wesentlicher Bestandteil sämtlicher Stoffwechselprozesse im Körper.
Mit zunehmendem Alter reduziert sich der Körperwasseranteil, das natürliche Durstempfinden schwindet. Zusätzlich wird das Handeln älterer Personen zunehmend von Vergesslichkeit und Nachlässigkeit geprägt. Die Gefahr einer gesundheits- oder gar lebensbedrohenden Dehydration steigt exponentiell an.
In deutschen Krankenhäusern wurden im Jahr 2017 über 125.000 Fälle von Volumenmangel als Hauptdiagnose festgestellt, 5.371 dieser Patienten verstarben noch im Krankenhaus.

Ob beim Pendeln, auf Geschäftsreisen oder bei der Arbeit mit Kollegen und Kunden - Cleanbrace versorgt Ihre Mitarbeiter bequem und verlässlich mit Desinfektionsmittel zur lokalen Handflächendesinfektion.

Neben dem intuitiven Erstellen und Vernetzen von Wissen in Guides, legen wir mit writeaguide auch einen großen Wert auf die datengesteuerte Wissensanalyse. Der Schlüssel dazu sind unsere komplexen Statistiken und Auswertungen. Sofort sind die Spezialisten zu einem Thema erkennbar, die Auswertungen zeigen, welche Teammitglieder schon die neue Schulung abgeschlossen haben oder wie der Wissenstransfer-Score für einen bestimmten Guide ist. So gestalten wir sämtliche Wissensprozesse schneller und übersichtlicher und geben den Verantwortlichen wieder mehr Zeit für die wesentlichen Dinge.

VYTAL,company,"In Germany the consumption of take-away, convenience and delivery food & drinks is responsible for about 281 kilotons of single-use packaging waste for immediate consumption and is growing at double digit rates. Most of the time, To-Go food containers, snack boxes or coffee cups have a very short life-span of only 30 minutes after which they are tossed into trash (or litter parks, beaches & the ocean). This is not only a giant waste of economic resources as each single use costs between 15 and up to 0,60€ for a stable bowl/box with a lid. It is a horrendous waste of environmental resources (wood, water, crude oil, metals & energy) that are used to produce this packaging. Therefore, a single use packaging not weighing more than 30 grams can easily come with an ecological backpack of more than 8 kilograms when taking into account all the resources used in production (material intensities taken from Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy). Looking at GHG emissions, the picture is similarly bleak: Using CO2 emission factors and the detailed material mix of the single-use packaging waste analyzed by NABU (German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union), the 281 thousand tons waste from To-Go consumption generated around 556 thousand tons of CO2 or the equivalent of 195k passenger cars per year (assuming an average distance travelled of 15,000km). With the expected rise of take-away, convenience and delivery food, the related emissions are expected to increase at double digit rates as waste volume is expected to increase and as we saw a shift to plastics relative to cardboard or other materials. While there is a growing awareness of the problem, especially in Germany, there is no scalable solution yet and the commonly used alternative of nature-based & ‘biodegradable’ materials like bagasse or PLA also require many resources for production & transport, and have to be incinerated or go to landfill after use as there is currently no way to compost them.",51-200,70.0,late growth,16K,2019.0,False,True,False,11.09,9.09,operational,2022-09-01 03:11:07,2020-02-18 13:06:34,26913.0,0,2022-03-16 13:51:02,7,16055,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Durch den Einsatz der Legal Tech Lösung von rfrnz sollen Juristen*innen von Routineaufgaben befreit werden und bessere Ergebnisse bei ihren Tätigkeiten erzielen. 

Die Contract Intelligence Platform erkennt relevante Informationen in Verträgen und Dokumenten wie Themen, Klauseln oder Einzeldaten und extrahiert diese. Unübliche oder fehlende Klauseln werden identifiziert. Die Ergebnisse können mit eigenem Standard bzw. zwei korrespondierende Verträge können automatisiert auf Übereinstimmung abgeglichen werden. 

Besonders geeignet ist das System bei der häufigen Prüfung von einzelnen (Standard-) Verträgen (bspw. NDA, AGB, AVV) und bei der Verarbeitung großer Datenmengen (bspw. bei der Legal Due Diligence in M&A-Transaktionen, Compliance). 

Die flexible Lösung von rfrnz ist in der Lage, schnell neue Vertragsarten und Sprachen zu lernen. Seitens der Kunden ist kein aufwändiges Training oder Labeling notwendig, unsere Anwendung ist sofort einsetzbar. Unsere Vertragsspezialisten trainieren die Plattform mit Beispielsklauseln und das System lernt dadurch, Klauseln und Inhalte wiederzuerkennen. 

Die Lösung funktioniert als eigenständige Webanwendung oder als Integration mit anderen Systemen, z.B. Software für Vertragsmanagement und CRM oder virtuelle Datenräume. Sie kann leicht in bestehende Workflows integriert werden.

High Bridge Management Academy,company,"I'm Flavio, Founder at High Bridge.

I've always been astonished at the professional skills gap of young people joining their first companies.

Universities innovate slowly – that is the harsh reality.  They lack the incentives to adapt to rapid market changes.

On the other hand, companies often underinvest in training their new recruits - and rather choose to not assign them roles of responsibility.

The result? A lose-lose situation, where the talent and motivation of recruits get wasted as they are given little or no real responsibilities at work for a long time.

Our answer to this problem is High Bridge Management Academy – a school for young talent to bridge the professional skills gap.

We envision a world where junior employees arrive at the workplace ready to take ownership of truly impactful projects right away, as they will already possess the necessary skill set and attitude for that.

High performance also leads to much greater career satisfaction and work-life balance.

Thus, it becomes a win-win situation for everyone.

High Bridge Management Academy is a next-generation consulting bootcamp, combining elite workshops, focused exercises, and professional coaching to prepare you to get top job offers & thrive as a consultant.

It's designed and delivered by a team of 40+ ex-McKinsey, Bain, and BCG consultants with over 100+ years of combined consulting experience, to bring elite interview and consulting skills to young talent.

Our pedagogical DNA is to directly provide: 
-Market professionals over professors 
-Work skills over academic skills 
-Class interaction over one-directional lecturing.

Back in 2018, we saw everything crash and burn as one of our biggest projects was failing. As a result of this failure, we learned how to transform and scale our business.

First, we’ve transformed our own 2 local businesses with over 43 local employees into a digital workforce with virtual teams of over 150 global freelancers. Based on that experience we’ve built Flash Hub as a platform to scale systematically with virtual teams in the most flexible and reliable way.

One thing became very clear after all these trials and tribulations; 
Work can be different, work can be free and without limits, and work can be done by people who like their job, who can be independent and self-determined, and work can be done by people who see their job as something positive in their lives.

What we recently introduced in our offer that can help you transform and grow is 
- The Flash Hub Academy: a starter pack with 15 videos on how to build your own highly efficient remote team of global freelancers; 
- The Virtual Team Challenge: two-week group coaching featuring Manuel Pistner himself, where you will learn to build your own digital leadership system; and finally, 
- Personal support, where together with you, we analyze your individual business goals and create the blueprint of your virtual teams that can scale reliably with global freelancers.

Spanflug Technologies GmbH,company,"Spanflug Technologies GmbH is an online manufacturer of CNC turning and milling parts that offers its customers a fully automated procurement process. To calculate a price in the online shop the user uploads a CAD model (STEP file) of the component to be manufactured, selects the desired material, the quantity (1 - 1000) and the delivery date. In addition, the customer can upload a PDF of the technical drawing to automatically read out information on individual manufacturing tolerances, fits, threads and surfaces. This allows functional components with high technical requirements to be considered. By applying an algorithm, the platform calculates a quotation price in a few seconds. Based on this price customers can order the components directly online.  With Spanflug, the effort to request and wait for price quotes from multiple suppliers is eliminated. The ordering process is often shortened from several days to a few minutes. If required, components will be delivered within 10 business days . The goal of the company, which was founded in January 2018, is to make the often time-consuming and resource-intensive bidding process for CNC turned and milled parts as quick and easy as possible for both customers and suppliers, and to advance the digitization of the manufacturing industry in the area of CNC turning and milling. The additional procurement costs for turned and milled parts can thus be reduced significantly. The production of the CNC components takes place exclusively with qualified suppliers in Germany. Spanflug is a spin-off from the Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb) of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and participated in the incubator program Xpreneurs of the UnternehmerTUM Entrepreneurship Network.

Anyware Solutions,company,"Our world is being digitized at a mind-boggling pace, and everything that can be digitized, will be digitized. 

However, most companies in traditional, utility-oriented industries such as energy, insurance and telecom fail to engage their homeowner customers with value-adding digital touchpoints and data-driven meaningful engagement. 

Consequently, they fail to create new revenue streams and retain the customer ownership despite their unique access to every home or building. 

Anyware’s unique end-to-end Digital Services and Data Analytics platform enable these companies to provide data-driven, meaningful customer engagement and create new revenue streams by turning the customer’s data into insights and personalized digital services. The digital services platform enable the Anyware partner to cater for a variety of segments as well as changing needs in the lives of end-user customers around these main applications: 

- Room Monitoring in buildings (offices, schools, institutions)
- Smarter Living for households in terms of family safety and prevention
- Care Monitoring for elderly living alone and their next-of-kin

If you want to lean how Anyware can help you win the customer’s loyalty by offering relevant and meaningful value-added bundles around your core offer, don’t hesitate to drop an email to sales@anyware.solutions.

Why It Matters More Than You May Think:

If you are NOT perceived relevant by your customer today, you will be replaced on your customer’s first date with a competitor, and it may be happening right now.

And in order to be relevant for your customer, you must care about and get to know the needs and preferences of your customer through data and in-app dialogue.

With the help of our scientific self-testing kits, you can get to know your microbiome better. This will help you find out which adjustments you can make to better understand your health and feel perfectly fit and balanced.

Mithilfe der DropFriends-App (erhältlich im Google Play Store und App Store), unseren Online-Software-Produkten (SaaS) und unserer technischen Schnittstelle (Public API) entscheiden z.B. Besteller beim Shopping, wohin Pakete geliefert werden, wenn sie nicht zu Hause sind. Während des Einkaufs und nicht erst danach. Natürlich zustellerunabhängig und an relevante Standorte in der Nachbarschaft oder auf dem Heimweg. Kurze Wege sind King!

Wir entwickeln Online-Software, die es dem Einzelhandel und den Online-Händlern erlaubt Service- und Logistikkosten einzusparen, Retouren zu vermeiden, vorort unabhängig von gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Öffnungszeiten zu sein und sichtbarer für Zielgruppen zu werden.

Endlich wird die Zustellung von Verkäufen für Verbraucher unkompliziert. Und das nur indem wir den Fokus vom Zustellmanagement von Kurieren, Boten und Lieferanten zum Empfangsmanagement setzen. Das spart für Shops Aufwand, Kosten und zwei Drittel CO2 pro Paketsendung. Da freut sich sogar die Umwelt.

Maon,company,"Decisions in energy markets are all about the future. But, the future is driven by a mix of uncontrolled factors such as climate change, public policy and innovative technologies. To make optimal decisions, complex outcomes need to be forecasted with speed and accuracy.

Forecasts represent a necessity for trader’s positions or investor’s evaluations of plants, consumers and sector couplings. Same applies to transmission grid operation and planning as well as topics of public interest like market design analysis or security of supply assessments.

As a result, we developed in 2018 the world’s first browser-based high spatial resolution electricity market model. The integrated simulation environment enables fast and cost-efficient in-depth market analysis without schooling and without any installation of hardware or software.

The unique platform supports users by parallel mobile workflows and instant visualizations. Ready-to-start input data with close-to-reality results enable immediate usage. Results like unit commitments and electricity prices can be analyzed rapidly via graphs and maps in the browser.

In high-stakes energy markets this gives a remarkable advantage. It predicts the future so it is possible to choose the right action in the right moment. Maon enables to make the most accurate and curtain decision possible within minutes knowing what to do and what not to do.

Das Bedürfnis nach gesunder & nachhaltiger Ernährung sowie Lebensweise ist so groß wie nie, dabei sterben heutzutage mehr Menschen an den Folgen falscher Ernährung als Mangelernährung!

Heilfasten ist eine evidenzbasierte Prävention & Therapie für zahlreiche grassierende Leiden unserer Zeit: Diabetes, Bluthochdruck und Adipositas – die häufigsten Todesursachen falscher Ernährung!

Trotz eindeutiger Datenlage werden die vielseitigen und nachhaltigen Effekte des Fastens leider kaum genutzt. Für Patienten und Ärzte ist Heilfasten meist zu teuer & aufwendig – das wollen wir ändern!

Tillhub,company,"Tillhub ist ein Software Startup aus Berlin, das ein cloud basiertes, smartes All-in-One Kassensystem entwickelt und vertreibt. Das Unternehmen wurde 2015 in Berlin gegründet und wird von Frank Seite, Oliver Mickler und Tim Seite geführt. Die innovative Point-of-Sale Lösung hilft kleinen und mittelgroßen Einzelhändlern, Dienstleistern und Gastronomen ihre Geschäftsprozesse zu digitalisieren und schneller zu wachsen. 

Die Inspiration für die smarte All-in-One Kasse kam Tillhub durch den wachsenden Bedarf an digitalen Lösungen für den Einzelhandel und den zunehmenden gesetzlichen Anforderungen. Das Kassensystem soll dem Unternehmer die Sicherheit geben, die er braucht, um zukünftig auch gegen den Online-Wettbewerb bestehen zu können und sein Unternehmen besser zu kennen.

Das All-in-One Kassensystem überzeugt neben einem intuitiven Kassiervorgang durch umfangreiche Zusatzfunktionen wie Mitarbeiter- und Kundenmanagement, E-Commerce Anbindung, digitales Kassenbuch, Warenwirtschaft und DATEV-Exporten. Die mobile Bedienoberfläche erlaubt eine wesentlich flexiblere Handhabung als ein klassisches System und ist so intuitiv konzipiert, dass sich jeder Mitarbeiter direkt zurechtfindet und kassieren kann. 

Mit seinem Kooperationspartner Seithe & Partner kann das Unternehmen auf über 25 Jahre Erfahrung im Bereich Softwareentwicklung für den Einzelhandel zurückgreifen. Entsprechend ist Sicherheit und Sorgfalt bei Tillhub oberstes Gebot. 

Das Kundenportfolio von Tillhub reicht vom kleinen Floristen, der die Einfachheit und Intuitivität der Bedienoberfläche schätzt, über den Bäcker, bei dem es oft schnell gehen muss, bis hin zum großen Filialisten, der zentral all seine Geschäfte managen möchte. 

Neben neuen Features plant Tillhub sich als elementarer Knotenpunkt im Handel zu festigen und immer mehr Einzelhändler, Dienstleister und Gastronomen dabei unterstützen, tolle Produkte zu verkaufen.

- Umfassende Digitalisierung aller Maße als Grundlage für Industrie 4.0.

CARGOMETER bietet zudem zahlreiche Zusatzmodule, die jederzeit zu- oder abgeschaltet werden können. Und wir arbeiten ständig an der Enwicklung weiterer Module, um auch in Zukunft Ihre Bedürfnisse abzudecken.

Ein Vermessungssystem – viele Möglichkeiten

Abgestimmt auf die Gegebenheiten beim Kunden bietet CARGOMETER individuell flexible Lösungen - egal ob Sie Frachten bei einzelnen Toren vermessen wollen oder Verladung über Portale betreiben oder beides kombinieren wollen.

Die Zukunft

Mit Verfügbarkeit der Volumeninformation kann außerdem erstmalig die Auslastung der europaweiten Stückgutnetzwerke auf Grundlage von realen Daten optimiert werden. Dies wird zu signifikanten Kosteneinsparungen und zu einer deutlichen Verringerung der Umweltbelastung führen.

Most companies in industry and construction are nowhere near reaching their full revenue potential.

They generate most of their revenue through reactive sales methods such as trade shows, leads from their personal relationships or by waiting for tenders and direct approaches.

But the industry is changing. Companies that have been selling door closers for decades have transformed into suppliers of entry solutions, modular construction firms are replacing on-site installers, and more and more players from Asia or companies like Amazon are pushing into the European construction market. Therefore traditional sales methods alone are not enough

Through our work with hundreds of companies in this space, we have built a Revenue Engineering solution. Combining AI data insights, process excellence and talent development, Building Radar uncovers your untapped revenue potential and helps you to capture it by building a scalable and measurable sales pipeline.

Don’t just rely on your great solutions. Empower your sales teams to win the most lucrative and profitable projects. We have already helped businesses like Schüco, Viessmann or Siemens close over €2B in untapped revenue. Let's find out the potential impact  revenue engineering can bring to your business today.

Die Baubranche ist stark fragmentiert und oft sind Akteure nicht ausreichend miteinander vernetzt. Das führt zu komplizierten Prozessen auf Angebots- und Nachfrageseite. Immer mehr Unternehmen sehen den Bedarf einer Digitalisierung und entwickeln Silo-Lösungen.

STYLIQUE vernetzt die wichtigsten Partner zur Umsetzung von Innenausbau-/Renovierungsprojekten: Hersteller, Händler, Architekten, Handwerker und Endkunden. 
Das ermöglicht eine nahtlose und somit einfache Abwicklung des gesamten Innenausbaus/Renovierung auf einer einzigen Plattform. 

Hersteller und Händler werden in der Digitalisierung unterstützt und nutzen die Plattform als Marketing- und Distributionskanal für mehr Reichweite.
Die gesamte Community erstellt Inspiration, die direkt mit Produkten verknüpft werden und durch einen Design-Algorithmus können genau die richtigen Produkte gefunden werden.

INNOVATIVE ANALYSE VON NETZWERKEN

Mit tagtäglich zahllosen neuen Beiträgen in Social Media wird es immer schwieriger, die Bedürfnisse und Vorlieben der Kunden zu verstehen. Wir helfen Ihnen, Ihre Zielgruppe online zu finden und Ihren Puls zu fühlen – Finden Sie heraus, worüber Ihre Zielgruppe spricht, was sie emotional bewegt, und passen Sie Ihre Marketingstrategie entsprechend an!
Zudem verliert das klassische Online-Marketing immer mehr an Boden gegenüber neuen Formen der Marken- und Produktwerbung. Traditionelles Influencer-Marketing übergibt die Marketingaktivitäten an einflussreiche Konsumenten. Allerdings ist es oft noch unausgereift. Wir berücksichtigen ganzheitliche Netzwerkstrukturinformationen bei der Bewertung wirklich einflussreicher Konsumenten. Wir glauben, dass gutes Influencer-Marketing auf Authentizität, wissenschaftlichem Denken und Vertrauen basiert.

Was wir machen:

Audience Insights and Social Listening
Finden Sie Ihre Zielgruppe auf Social Media und gewinnen Sie datengetriebene Einblicke darüber – welche Themen treiben die Diskussion? Was beschäftigt die Nutzer? Wie ist ihre Stimmung? Hören Sie in Social Media-Kanäle herein und erfahren Sie, wie Konsumenten Ihre Marke und Produkte wahrnehmen.

Rehago.eu,company,"Virtual Reality Training für halbseitig Gelähmte #eHealth #Training #Schlaganfall

Allein in Deutschland werden jährlich etwa 500.000 Menschen NEU mit einer halbseitigen Lähmung (Hemiparese) diagnostiziert. 

Das entspricht fast einem neuen Betroffenen pro Minute!

Weltweit sind das hochgerechnet um die 25 Millionen Menschen. 

Damit gehen erhebliche Einschränkungen im Alltag einher: 
die Betroffenen haben Probleme sich selbständig anzuziehen und zu versorgen. 
Sie können ihren Hobbys, Arbeit und Sozialleben nicht mehr wie gewohnt nachgehen.

Der wichtigste Faktor für einen erfolgreichen Wiedereinstieg in ein eigenständiges Leben ist ein konsequentes und intensives Training. 

Die begrenzten Ressourcen in unserem Gesundheitssystem reichen jedoch nicht für ein hochintensives Training zur optimalen Genesung aus. Die Möglichkeiten für das Heimtraining sind langweilig, demotivierend oder viel zu teuer.

Rehago ermöglicht weltweit Millionen halbseitig gelähmten Menschen den Wiedereinstieg in ein eigenständiges Leben zu beschleunigen. 

Mit modernen Virtual Reality Spielen bieten wir den Betroffenen ein unabhängiges, günstiges und motivierendes Training und ermutigen sie regelmäßig an ihre Leistungsgrenze zu gehen. 

Dank der Mobilität des Systems kann in der Klinik, im Pflegeheim oder zu Hause geübt werden, wobei die Betroffenen selbständig oder in Begleitung eines Therapeuten trainieren können.

Das Unternehmen beschäftigt derzeit rund 115 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter und wird im Laufe des Jahres auf ca. 175 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter anwachsen.

Die DFV legt großen Wert auf eine hohe Kundenzufriedenheit. Produktseitig wird diese erzielt durch die genannten Spitzenbewertungen bei Stiftung Warentest.

Mootral,company,"MOOTRAL is a British-Swiss AgriTech company that develops innovative solutions for companies and governments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as the usage of antibiotics in the agricultural sector. Our first technology is Mootral Ruminant, a natural feed supplement that significantly reduces methane emissions from ruminants. Mootral Ruminant is based on a proprietary combination of garlic and citrus extracts.

The Mootral business model sets out to prove “there is good business in the business of doing good”. Mootral unlocks new, innovative and profitable approaches to reducing GHG emissions, including the creation of a new climate-friendly food standard for beef and dairy products and a “cow credit” currency. Mootral is a “win-win” for all, but especially for farmers. Today, farmers are facing economic hardships and regulatory challenges unforeseen just a few decades ago. In order to support their future financial prosperity in a sustainable way, and one that meets the emerging needs of consumers, new thinking is needed. Mootral is the result of that thinking – bringing strong benefits to all stakeholders.

Cows, being the highest methane producers amongst ruminants, are a crucial factor in our environmental ecosystem and the economy, Mootral is setting the foundation for the future through a solution that makes an impact today. It enables a positive transition to climate-smart agriculture designed to help farmers earn more money and industry partners to reduce their impact on the environment. The future is climate-smart and the future is now.

Kunde: Dominik Kraetz, Patisserie Isabella Hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Vielen Dank für den tollen Service! Kunde: Gesa Stockburger, Diginet Unsere Referenzen Gastronomiebedarf günstig im Gastro Online Shop kaufen Gastronomiebedarf Gastronomiebedarf / Hotelbedarf - endlich Alles an einem Ort! Gastrozentrale.de ist Deutschlands große Beschaffungsplattform für Großküchentechnik und Gastronomiebedarf / Hotelbedarf. Wir bieten die Anlaufstelle für alle, die auf der Suche nach hochwertiger Gastronomieeinrichtung sind und einen Full-Service gerne in Anspruch nehmen. Ob Getränketheke, Pizzaöfen, Flaschenkühler oder Dampfgarer, bei uns finden Sie alles für die Einrichtung von Bars, Cafés und Restaurantbetrieben  die besten Marken, die neueste Technik, schnell geliefert und zum fairen Preis. Neben unserem Bestsellersortiment bieten wir auch immer wieder Rabatte und Sonderaktionen in unserem Newsletter und in den sozialen Medien an. Von A wie Aufschnittmaschine über P wie Pizzaofen bis Z wie Zahnstocher Auf Gastrozentrale.de finden Sie über 50.000 Artikel, von Großküchentechnik über wie z.B. Gewerbekühlschränke und Konvektomaten bis hin zu Kleingeräte für die professionelle Gastronomie wie Pattyformer und Porzellangeschirr. Natürlich haben wir auch sonstigen Gastronomiebedarf des täglichen Gebrauchs im Angebot. Gemäß unserem Motto Finde schnell was du brauchst haben wir unseren Online-Shop übersichtlich strukturiert. Wählen Sie die Hauptkategorie in der oberen Navigation und schon erhalten Sie eine Auswahl weiterer Unterkategorien. In der Kategorie Kühltechnik finden Sie z.B. die Unterkategorien: Gewerbekühlschränke, Kühltheken, Kühlregale oder Kühlvitrinen. Schließlich wollen Sie als Kunde bei der Suche Zeit und Geld sparen! Wir machen ernst mit Kundenzufriedenheit Apropos Kunde: Sie betreiben ein Restaurant, ein Hotel, einen Imbiss oder müssen in einem Unternehmen eine gewerbliche Küche einrichten? Dann kennen Sie sicher auch die Tatsache, wie oft neuer Gastronomiebedarf gebraucht wird - und dass die laufenden Investitionen oft schnell ins Geld gehen können. Guter Rat ist hier oft teuer. Welcher Hersteller von Gaststättenbedarf ist der richtige, wie kann man an günstigere Preise herankommen, und das am Besten noch mit solider, professioneller Beratung von einem fachkundigen Partner? Sie wollen zum Beispiel eine Cocktailbar einrichten und brauchen einen Eiswürfelbereiter, einen Getränkekühlschrank und entsprechenden Barbedarf. Oder Sie suchen einen Pizzaofen und sind verunsichert ob der großen Preisunterschiede? Ihr lokaler Händler hat nur alte Geräte herumstehen, oder eine zu kleine Auswahl - im Internet dagegen sehen Sie nur einen Haufen bunte Bilder und wissen nicht, auf welche Qualitätsmerkmale Sie achten sollen. Zentralisieren Sie Ihren Einkauf mit Gastrozentrale Hier kommt Gastrozentrale ins Spiel. Wir kommen vom Fach und richten seit über 30 Jahren gewerbliche Küchen, Bars, Diskotheken und Gaststätten ein. So haben wir entsprechende Fachleute für Großküchentechnik und Edelstahlmöbel, Gläser, Hotelporzellan und gedeckten Tisch, aber auch für die neuesten Trends in der Gastronomie wie Sous-Vide Cooking, BBQ Grills und Smoker, die auch dem härtesten Restaurantbetrieb standhalten. Mit der richtigen Beratung kann man hier nicht nur die geeigneten Hersteller und Produkte finden, (sondern auch eine Menge Geld sparen). Und das nicht nur beim Einkauf selbst, sondern auch bei der Montage und Installation der Großküchengeräte, sowie - Achtung auf die diversen Verordnungen - bei der Genehmigung und Abnahme der Geräte. Gastronomiebedarf ist also ein weites Feld. (Und, Hand auf's Herz: mit uns behalten Sie die Übersicht). Vom Zahnstocher über Speisekarten und Geschirr bis zu Produkten für Kochtechnik und Küchenabluft vertreibt Gastrozentrale on- und offline über 120.000 Produkte von mehr als 500 weltweiten Herstellern. Dadurch, dass wir schon lange in der Großküchenbedarf-Branche agieren, können wir hier nicht nur auf gute Beratung, sondern auch auf exzellente Einkaufskonditionen zurückgreifen. Die Suche hat ein Ende - sparen Sie mit uns echtes Geld Und, wichtig zu wissen: Wenn Sie dennoch etwas günstiger gefunden haben, greift im Zweifelsfall auch unsere Bestpreisgarantie. Doch achten Sie darauf: Nur weil die von Ihnen gesuchten Gegenstände in Küchen verwendet werden können, ist es nicht gleich echter Großküchenbedarf! Für die Gastro gibt es nicht nur spezielle Kleinteile und Artikel wie Tischwäsche, Speisekarten, Chafing Dishes oder natürlich die professionellen Geräte der Großküchentechnik - auch bei Servietten, Geschirr, Gastromöbel und Gläsern sollten Sie darauf achten, dass nur echter Gastrobedarf erworben wird - am Besten mit entsprechender Beratung von Gastrozentrale. Der erste Grund: in der Gastronomie und in Großküchen werden auch ""einfache"" Artikel wie Teller, Kochmesser, Tischwäsche, Besteck, aber auch Möbel viel stärker beansprucht und müssen auch unter stressigen Konditionen standhalten. Mehr als ein Online-Shop für Gastronomiebedarf Zweitens müssen die Gegenstände lange vorrätig sein und am Besten über eine Nachkaufgarantie verfügen, schließlich wollen Ihr Koch und Ihre Gäste die gewohnte Qualität beibehalten. Drittens gibt es massive Qualitätsunterschiede zwischen einzelnen Herstellern, die je nach Einsatzzweck günstig - oder ungeeignet sind. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel einen Bratwurststand oder einen Dönergrill besitzen, werden Sie wahrscheinlich auf Plastikgeschirr und Einwegbesteck zurückgreifen können. Wenn Sie Betreiber einer Showküche oder eines Hotelrestaurants sind, brauchen Sie qualitativ hochwertigen Gastronomiebedarf, der auch vor dem Gast einen guten Eindruck macht. Die Kunst der richtigen Produktauswahl steckt hier oft im Detail. Dürfen im Bereich Barausstattung Ihre Ausgießer aus Plastik sein, und können sie auch zähflüssige Liköre ausgießen? Sind die Longdrink-Gläser für Ihre Diskothek auch bruchfest und vertragen robuste Handhabung? Ist das Einweggeschirr für Ihren Catering-Event biologisch abbaubar, hitze- und feuchtigkeitsbeständig sowie geschmacksneutral? Ist die Eiswürfelmaschine besser Luft-, oder Wasser-gekühlt? Vertragen Ihre Gastro-Möbel auch abenteuerlustige Kinder und nassen Fußboden? Am besten, Sie reden mit echten Profis - mit unserem Team bei Gastrozentrale. Bei uns beraten nur echte Experten Unsere Gastronomieexperten haben jahrelange Erfahrung als Koch, Catering-Unternehmer, Hotelfachmann und Gastrofachberater gesammelt und beraten Sie kostenlos und unverbindlich zum Thema Großküchentechnik und Gastronomiebedarf. Ob Kühltheke, Fleischwolf, Pattyformer, Pizzateller, Edelstahlmöbel oder ausgefallene Speisekarte: Egal welche Produkte Sie suchen, wir finden genau das, was Sie brauchen, und das zum günstigen Preis mit dem richtigen Service. Testen Sie uns und besuchen Sie heute noch unseren Online-Shop. Und sollten Sie einmal nicht das finden, was Sie brauchen, sprechen Sie mit einem unserer Berater. Wir freuen uns auf Sie! Großküchenplanung Großküchenplanung und Gastronomieberatung - wir bauen Ihren Laden, und helfen Ihnen beim Wachsen! Wussten Sie schon? Gastrozentrale ist nicht nur ein Großküchen-Shop - als echter Gastro-Dienstleister entwerfen und gestalten auch Ihre ganz individuellen gastronomischen Träume, und das mit mehr als dreißig Jahren Erfahrung in der Branche (mehr dazu auch in unserem Firmenportrait). Von der Neuplanung oder dem Umbau von Gastronomieküchen / Hotelküchen über die Gestaltung oder Renovierung des Gastraums bis hin zur fertigen Szene-Bar oder Ihrem ersten, eigenen Franchising-System - wir stehen Ihnen zu Seite! Dabei legen wir nicht nur Wert auf eine konzeptionell wie handwerklich exzellente CAD-Planung und eine Kücheneinrichtung mit guten Preis-/ Leistungverhältnis - wir sehen auch Ihr Projekt stets als Ganzes, hinter dem viele Erwartungen - und Risiken! - seiner Auftraggeber stehen. Daher beraten wir Sie gerne auf Wunsch auch zusätzlich von der Konzeptoptimierung über die Budget- und Küchenplanung bis hin zur Einkaufsoptimierung sowie der Finanzierung und Expansion Ihres Vorhabens  (bis Sie wirklich zufrieden sind). Unsere Erfahrung mit Großküchen: Zuverlässigkeit, Einsatz und immer eine Idee mehr. Ob Cook-and-Serve, Cook-and-Chill oder als Zentralküche mit anschließender Speisenvakuumierung und -frostung. Wir kennen die Anforderungen an moderne, gewerbliche Gastro-Küchen aus Individualgastronomie, Hotellerie und Gemeinschaftsverpflegung. Stets auf dem neuesten Stand der Technik, aber mit einem gesunden unternehmerischen Blick auf Ihren Geldbeutel helfen wir Ihnen, aus einer Örtlichkeit und Ihrem Budget das Beste herauszuholen. Gemeinsam mit Ihnen und einem industrieerfahrenen Dienstleister-Team gehen wir auf die örtlichen Gegebenheiten ein, schätzen und unterstützen bauliche Veränderungen und helfen Ihnen bei der finalen Realisierung Ihres gastronomischen Vorhabens. Dabei beachten und optimieren wir nicht nur die Raumaufteilung sowie Laufwege in Küche, Lager und Speisenausgabe, sondern legen auch großen Wert auf neueste Energiekonzepte und wirtschaftliche Nachhaltigkeit. Und sollten Sie einmal ein ausgefallenes, aber dennoch vielversprechendes Konzept verfolgen - wir gehen gern die Extrameile und beschaffen genau das, was Sie für Ihren Traum benötigen: Nudelmaschinen aus Japan, BBQ-Smoker aus Texas sowie Tantuni-Stationen aus Marokko. (Durch unser internationales Investoren-Netzwerk und unsere Erfahrung bei Förderbanken können wir nebenbei dem ein oder anderen Projekt auch zu größerer finanzieller Stärke verhelfen.) Unser Leistungsspektrum im Überblick: 1. Gastronomieberatung im Bereich Konzepte und Vorhabenplanung Quick-Check und Konzeptanalyse, ob als direkter Berater der Geschäftsführung oder als ausführender Dienstleister Konzeptoptimierung und 100 Punkte Plan Logoentwurf und Mood-Board Gestaltung inkl. Konzepte für Farb- und Materialspektrum Produktauswahl und Innenraumplanung, gerne auch in 3D-Visualisierung Menüoptimierung und Food-Produktenwicklung Beschaffungsberatung Food/Non-Food und Einkaufsoptimierung Permanente Unterstützung bei der Umsetzung 2. Großküchenplanung (alle Leistungsphasen) als professionelle Planungsgesellschaft Grundlagenermittlung, auch anhand von Referenzen und Skizzen Standortanalyse oder Umbau-Analyse Auswahl der richtigen Großküchentechnik Vorplanung der Großkücheneinrichtung Entwurfsplanung in 3D CAD und Visualisierung Genehmigungsplanung Ausführungsplanung als Fachplaner Objekt-/ Bauüberwachung bis zur Montage Objektbetreuung aller Großküchen als unterstützender Dienstleister 3. Finanzierungs- und Betriebsberatung (Optional) Erstellung eines Finanzplans und einer Projekt-Timeline, z.B. für Neugründung oder Umbau Hilfe bei der Erstellung eines Businessplans und der GmbH-Gründung Unterstützung bei der Auswahl und Ansprache geeigneter Finanzierungspartner Kostenanalyse und Verbesserung von Einparpotenzialen Unterstützung bei der Personalakquise Übersicht im Verordnungsdschungel - dank unserer Gastrozentrale-Experten Auf einen Auftraggeber und Bauherren in der Großküchenplanung, als auch auf uns als Dienstleister kommen heutzutage eine Menge Regeln zu: HACCP-Hygienebestimmungen, Richtlinien bei der Lebensmittelverordnung, Europäische Gesetzgebungen bei Mensen und Betriebscasinos, Arbeitsstätten-Vorgaben und Baunormen für Hotellerie, Kühlkettenverordnungen in Schulmensen und der Gemeinschaftsverpflegung, Ergonomische Aspekte bei der Bargestaltung, Vergabekriterien bei der Planung und Ausschreibung, Richtlinien bei Sanitär und Lüftung - und manches mehr. Dank unserer In-House Dienstleister und des Gastrozentrale-Expertennetzwerks kein Problem! Wir kennen die Tücken der offiziellen Normen für Großküchentechnik und helfen Ihnen gleich zu Beginn Ihres Projektes, Kollisionen mit örtlichen und bundesweiten Gesetzgebungen zu vermeiden. Mit unseren Checklisten und Praxis-Tipps geben wir Ihnen vor und während der Projektzeit auch Instrumente an die Hand, Ihrem Vorhaben zum Erfolg zu verhelfen. Unser Repertoire als Dienstleister in der Großküchentechnik: Vom Szeneclub bis hin zur Hotelküche Es gibt wohl kaum einen Küchentypus, mit dem wir als Planer und Berater für die Gastro nicht schon Erfahrung gemacht hätten. Dabei machen wir oft die Erfahrung, dass einzelne Gastronomie-Kategorien immer stärker verschmelzen. Auch Kantinen von Großunternehmen wollen heute gutes Design und gesundes, trendiges Essen anbieten, Sterneläden bieten plötzlich Take-Away an, und Szene-Gastronomen wiederum sind froh, bei Arbeitsabläufen und HACCP-Hygienekonzepten auf unsere Erfahrungen aus der Betriebsgastronomie zurückgreifen zu können. Egal ob Dönergrill oder Hotelbar - die Ansprüche der Gäste sind höher geworden: gesundes Essen, Drinks mit ""Signatur"" und Licht- bzw. Raumkonzepte, bei der Ernährung, Freizeit und soziales Erlebnis miteinander verschmelzen. Dabei spielen auch allgemeine, gesellschaftliche Trends eine Rolle, z.B. Müllvermeidung, regionaler Bezug oder kreativ-frecher Umgang mit verschiedenen ethnischen Herkünften. Doch keine Sorge: Wir von Gastrozentrale leben nicht in einem ""Elfenbeinturm"" der technischen Großküchenplanung: wir sprechen täglich mit Meinungsmachern und Trendsettern in der Gastronomie, bilden uns und unsere Mitarbeiter ständig fort und arbeiten bei kniffligen Fragen auch mit renommierten Spezialisten zusammen. Unser Motto ""die Gastroexperten"" heißt nämlich auch, dass Gastronomie immer auch Gemeinschaftsleistung ist. Nur gemeinsam mit unseren Mitarbeitern, und nur zusammen mit Ihnen können wir zur Höchstform auflaufen. Die folgende Liste gibt Ihnen einen Überblick über die Verpflegungs- und Küchen-Konzepte, in denen wir diese Gemeinschaftsleistung schon erbracht haben. Kantinen Betriebsgastronomie Altenheimküchen Mensen Schulverpflegung Hotels Krankenhausverpflegung Traditions- und Sport-Gaststätten Erlebnisgastronomie Szenegastronomie Catering Einzelhandel und Verkaufsstände (Food) Bars und Diskotheken Imbisskonzepte und mobile Küche Food-Trucks Sonstige Großküchenplanung und Großküchentechnik Weitere, konkrete Referenzen aus unserem Leistungsspektrum nennen wir gerne auf Nachfrage. Noch besser aber ist: Sie vereinbaren gleich ein kostenloses Erstgespräch mit uns. Wir kommen gerne zu Ihnen und eruieren Ihre Wünsche und Vorhaben. Als erfahrenes und hochmotiviertes Planungsbüro, als Top-Dienstleister für die Großkücheneinrichtung und vor allem als echte Fans gelungener gastronomischer Einrichtungen und treuer Partner auf Augenhöhe. Gerne erhalten Sie auch vorab eine Broschüre über unser Leistungsspektrum und unsere Beratungs-Konzepte inkl. Firmenportrait unserer GmbH. Service Wenn's mal eilig wird: Ersatzteil-Service und Servicenetzwerk Kennen Sie das? Ihr Restaurant läuft auf Hochbetrieb, und plötzlich fällt der Pizzaofen oder Filter für den Eiswürfelbereiter aus, oder die Gummidichtung Ihrer Spülmaschine funktioniert nicht mehr richtig? Die Kaffeemühlen geben nur noch komische Geräusche von sich, der Kombidämpfer läuft aus und die Saladetten sind plötzlich handwarm? Alltagskatastrophe in der Gastronomie - jetzt braucht es einen kühlen Kopf und einen schnellen Ersatzteilservice für Großküchentechnik und Gastronomiebedarf! Hilfe naht: der Rund-Um Service und Ersatzteilfinder von Gastrozentrale Unter der Telefonnummer 0800-672 672 672 und hier im Webshop steht Ihnen unser Ersatzteile-Team zur Verfügung. Wir führen über 120.000 Ersatzteile für die Großküche, Gastronomie und Hotellerie und haben gute Chancen, dass auch Ihr gesuchtes Produkt darunter ist. Egal ob Brennerdeckel oder Drehknopf für den Gasgrill, ein Heizkörper für die gebrauchten Pizzaöfen, ein Thermostat für defekte Hähnchengrills, ein neuer Ventilator für den Konvektomaten, ein spezielles Scharnier für den Getränkekühlschrank oder einfach nur ein passender Friteusenkorb - wir finden mit Ihnen heraus, wo der Schuh drückt und handeln schnell und engagiert. Und wenn mal etwas außerhalb der Öffnungszeiten schief läuft, finden Sie mit unserem Ersatzteilfinder für Kochtechnik, Spültechnik, Kühltechnik und Lüftungstechnik rasch das passende Teil, das sofort automatisch für Sie bestellt wird. Mit unserem Riesen-Sortiment decken wir dabei folgende Marken und Gerätetypen für den Einsatz in Großküchen ab, z.B. Ersatzteile für Kochtechnik-Ersatzteile, z.B. Ventile und einen Einlaufhahn für Dampfgarer und Heißluftofen von Rational, Eloma, MKN, Convotherm und Unox Spültechnik-Ersatzteile, z.B. eine Dichtung oder ein Thermostat für eine (Hauben-)spülmaschine von Winterhalter, Meiko, Hobart, Stalgast und Colged Gas-Thermik-Teile für einen Gasofen und Gasgrill von Krefft, Baron, Ascoblock, Bertos und Heidebrenner Kältetechnik-Teile für einen Gewerbekühlschrank oder Schockfroster von Norcap, Irinox, ECO, COMPACT, Liebherr, KBS und GGG Frosttechnik-Artikel für Eisbereiter und Eiswürfelmaschinen von Hoshizaki, Wessamat, Manitowoc und Brema Ersatzartikel für einen Kühltisch, eine Kühltheke oder Getränketheke von KBS, Cool Compact, Chromornom, Cool Line, und Chromofair Austausch-Produkte für Arbeitschränke, Arbeitstische, Spültische und Edelstahlmöbel von GGG, Morgan, AfG, Lauterjung und GGM Reparatur-Teile für Salamander, Vakuumiergeräte, Aufschnittmaschinen und andere Gastrogeräte von Bartscher, Carpigiani, ADE, GRAEF Zubehör für Kaffeemühlen, Kaffeevollautomaten und Siebträgermaschinen von Jura, Saeco, Nespresso, Melitta, San Remo, Animo, Cimbali, La Marzocco, ECM, Gaggia und La Pavoni sowie Ersatzteile und Zubehör für den alltäglichen Gastronomiebedarf und Hotelbedarf wie Gemüseschneider (z.B. Robo Coupe, GAM) Müslispender (z.B: Frilich, Pulsiva), Entsafter (z.B. Santos, Gastroback), Mixer (z.B. Dynamics, Hamilton Beach) und nahezu alle anderen elektrischen und mechanischen Kleingeräte aus der Gastro. Mit unserem speziellen Ersatzteilfinder können Sie schnell nach Marke, Gerät und Seriennummer suchen - und sollten Sie einmal etwas nicht finden, versuchen wir gerne, weltweit das richtige Produkt zu beschaffen, wenn möglich auch mit 24 Stunden-Service oder Overnight-Lieferung. Tipps für langlebige Geräte - Installation nur durch den Fachmann - das Gastrozentrale Service-Netzwerk Apropos kaputte Geräte: Immer wieder erleben wir, dass technische Produkte deutlich länger halten könnten, wenn sie fachgerecht von einem zertifizierten Handwerker angeschlossen geworden wären. Egal ob Wasserfilter für Eiswürfelmaschinen oder Wasseranschluss für einen Dampfgarer - wer beim Anschluss spart, zahlt hinterher oft zweimal! Bei der Suche nach dem perfekten Anschluss-Service ist guter Rat jedoch oft teuer: Welcher lokale Installateur oder Elektriker ist auch für Großküchen-Produkte geeignet und bringt die richtige Erfahrung mit? Hier kommen wir ins Spiel: Mit unserem Service-Netzwerk für Anschluss, Reparatur und Wartung finden wir für Sie den richtigen Partner. So arbeiten wir bundesweit mit über 1.200 Elektrikern, Kältetechnikern, Lüftungsplanern und Installateuren zusammen. Denn Ihr Gerät soll ja nicht nur angeschlossen, sondern auch regelmäßig geprüft, gewartet und repariert werden. Damit Sie hier nur echte Gastro-Experten in Ihre Küche lassen, arbeiten wir nur mit Partnern zusammen, die für Ihr neues Gerät auch autorisiert sind. Und sollte tatsächlich einmal etwas sein, rufen Sie uns gerne an oder schreiben Sie uns eine Mail. Wir kümmern uns gern! 123 456 789 Kontaktieren Sie uns!

Door2door,company,"There are gaps in every public transport network: At the outskirts of cities and in rural areas, in the evenings and on weekends. We identify these gaps, expand the network with a modern on-demand bus concept and integrate all existing offers into a smartphone app for citizens. This is the fastest way to wider public transport coverage. And the citizens are enthusiastic.

No bus station, a sparse timetable, special locations – every municipality has gaps in the network. Until now, citizens have used their cars to fill them. Our alternative: A public transport service with all the comfort of the car, in which the passenger can choose the pick-up and drop-off points. We combine all existing offers into the next public transport system. Efficient. Flexible. Digital.

CleverShuttle,company,"CleverShuttle is Germany's leading operator for on-demand ride-pooling services.

We partner with cities and public transport authorities to put on-demand transport on the road efficiently, so that more people can have convenient and affordable access to sustainable mobility. We want to see on-demand ride-pooling become fully integrated into our public transport systems – because only then will it be a real alternative to personal car ownership. 

With over six years of experience in demand-responsive transport (DRT), we cover all operational aspects of on-demand ride-pooling – ranging from demand forecasting and shift planning, through intelligent traffic control, to driver- and charge-management for electric fleets.

Our on-demand ride-pooling services provide people with a flexible mode of door-to-door transportation, where riders share a vehicle with others who are going in the same direction. Our fleets are electric and run on renewable energy. This lowers costs for riders while also decreasing traffic congestion and harmful emissions.

We currently operate on-demand services in seven German cities. Since starting out in 2014, we’ve helped over five million people get where they need to go.

Join us for the ride and help us shape the future of mobility: We are always looking for smart, dedicated, and open-minded people to join the team!

However, he also wanted these recordings to be available as soon as possible for marketing purposes in addition to documentation. He quickly found out two things about video live streaming: it would not be easy, and it would not be cheap. Actually, after shopping around for a provider who could provide this service, he realized that what he was asking for would be very complicated, and in turn, very expensive.   Sebastian and Gregor Landwehr (COO of Contentflow) knew then that they might have something. And that led to the birth of Contentflow. Four years later, Contentflow continues to succeed and soar. For example, Online Marketing Rockstars (OMR), the largest online marketing conference worldwide (40,000+ attendees) uses Contentflow to live broadcast on social media, including 102 different and simultaneous stream channels, including Facebook, YouTube, websites, etc.    Some exclusive features of Contentflow include: an Embeddable Video Player (allows rewinding of live stream in real time), Multistream (enables distribution of live stream among multiple platforms simultaneously), Audience Analytics (collects viewer data including number of streams and provides geolocation map), Overlay Graphic (adds branding and static overlay graphic during livestream) and Cloud-Based editing (allows immediate editing, cutting and sharing while streaming).

Claimtech Inc,company,"ClaimTECH Solutions delivers a unique and critical service by bridging the gap between insurance providers and hospitals to settle 3rd Party MVA Claims without the need for time consuming and expensive litigation.

Hospitals with Trauma centers see many MVA patients. A large portion of these claims involve third party claimants. The lack of ability to properly identify the responsible party throws the hospital into the precarious position of having to file a lien on the claim to ensure getting paid upon resolution of the claim. These cases often get protracted for various reasons and the claim can often reside on the hospital's accounts receivables for months, sometimes much longer. When the hospital finally does get reimbursed, it is often at a substantially lower figure than the original bill. So after months of waiting, the payment received is very small.

Meanwhile, the auto insurance company is notified by their insured, the injured claimant or a plaintiff attorney, that there has been a medical claim generated as a result of an accident. The insurance company is then compelled to perform its due diligence to determine if the party claiming damages is in fact entitled to any payments. With the dialogue impaired by compliance with HIPAA and the intervention of a plaintiff attorney or threat of same, these bills become difficult to address and resolve.

ClaimTECH facilitates a connection directly between the hospital and the auto insurance company using a HIPAA compliant cloud based portal for claims to be settled in a fraction of the time, creating improved savings and cash flow for all parties. When a claim is settled with ClaimTECH it is settled for good, regardless of outside influences.",11-50,12.0,early growth,,,False,False,False,0.0,,operational,2022-09-02 00:41:24,2021-12-27 13:27:26,595278.0,0,2021-12-27 14:01:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Transfection is a powerful method to introduce foreign DNA or RNA into eukaryotic cells. Delivery of nucleic acids into cells enables exploration of gene function and regulation, analysis of cellular pathways and signal transduction in cells, tissues and organisms. There are various transfection techniques developed: viral transduction, mechanical methods (such as electroporation or microinjection), chemical methods (such as calcium phosphate, polymers or lipofection) and hybrid methods (such as magnetofection). Nevertheless, a successful transfection of certain cells remains a challenging task. Lipocalyx develops and manufactures the new generation proprietary synthetic transfection reagents Viromer® based on high-tech polymers that combine the best features of chemical transfection and mimick the natural uptake of the influenza virus to enable an outstanding transfer of RNAs and DNA into various hard-to-transfect cells, including primary cells, stem cells or suspension cells. Viromer® are compatible as well with many classical immortalized cell lines, including cancer cell lines widely used in cell biology. They are highly efficient, easy to use and low-toxic transfection reagents. Our company proposes a range of five color-coded Viromer® with some differences in their structural chemistry but following the same workflow. Altogether, they are addressing all of common and more specific transfection uses: mRNA and plasmid transfection, RNA-interference technology and HTS - Kits for RNAi Screening. Viromer® RED   YELLOW are optimized for plasmid / mRNA transfection gene expression by using common plasmid or highly efficient mRNA transfection, even in hard-to-transfect cells Viromer® BLUE   GREEN are optimized for siRNA / miRNA transfection from down-regulation to silencing of genes by using siRNA, as well as stimulation of gene expression through miRNA transfection, even in very challenging cells Viromer® BLACK is optimized for siRNA / anti-miR transfection a premium reagent for extremely challenging cells and with excellent performance for transfecting single-stranded antagomiRs or antisense oligonucleotides How to choose? Lipocalyx provides and updates tables on the cell specificity. For cells not described in there, we offer ready-to-use positive controls for easy testing. You just need to rehydrate the samples and put it in the media to your cells. What is transfection? The technique can be used to express exogenous nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) in other cells. Plasmid DNA (pDNA) transfection is often the method of choice, lending itself to an array of gene expression or editing studies, by inserting the DNA of interest into the hosts nucleus where it is transcribed. While DNA may be more popular, using RNA opens up exploration of protein down-regulation with RNA interference (RNAi), or blocking microRNA (miRNA) activity, without the worry of modifying the hosts genome. Transfection using mRNA tends to be more efficient than DNA, but the transfected cells tend to produce less protein due to the limited lifespan of mRNA. These different approaches can be used to generate stable, or transient transfections, depending on your needs. Cells that have been transiently transfected express the exogenous gene without incorporating it into the genome. This means that the cells will not continue to express the gene of interest through subsequent replications. Transient transfection will persist for just a few days, after which the exogenous gene is lost through mitosis or degradation. If long-term exogenous gene expression is required, stable transfection methods can be employed to generate a permanent cell line. Cells are first transfected transiently with the gene of interest, and then co-transfected with a marker gene. A marker gene that offers a selectable advantage, such as resistance to an antibiotic or toxin, is typically used. So after transient transfection the stable method works by adding the antibiotic/toxin to the cell culture. It becomes easy to identify only those that have integrated the marker gene and in all likelihood the gene of interest, into their genomes. Viral transfection This stable method is known as transduction and uses a virus carrier for the delivery of exogenous genes or probes. The viral vectors are selected based upon the specific application, but usually fall into one of four categories. Adenoviruses: double-stranded DNA viruses primarily used for transient transfection and limited to 8 kb of insert in dividing and non-dividing cells. Adeno-associated viruses: single-stranded DNA viruses that are used for stable transfection and integrate at a specific chromosomal site in dividing and non-dividing cells. These have a limited packaging capacity at just a 5 kb insert. Retroviruses: viruses with RNA genomes capable of randomly inserting double-stranded DNA copies of their genome into the chromosomes of dividing cells. They are used in stable expression experiments and can carry genetic material up to 8 kb. Lentiviruses: a type of retrovirus capable of being used in both dividing and non-dividing cells for stable transfection with up to 9 kb of insert. Viral transfection has a very high gene delivery efficiency (95100%), is a relatively simple procedure and can be used in both in vivo and in vitro settings. Mechanical transfection These methods deliver nucleic acids to a host cell by physically manipulating the cell. Electroporation for example, is a widely used and highly efficient transfection technique. It works by exposing the cells to an electric field in order to cause a temporary destabilization of the cell membrane in the form of tiny holes known as electropores. While the electric field is applied, nucleic acids can move through these pores. When the field is switched off, the pores close, leaving the exogenous nucleic acids inside the host cell. This is a simple transfection method that can be applied to a range of cell types, but is prone to high cell mortality unless correctly implemented. Alternatively, microinjection can transfect the nucleic acids directly into the nucleus of the host cell. However, this process is both time-consuming as technically demanding. Chemical transfection methods Chemical transfection can be one of the most cost-effective options. These include the use of reagents such as DEAE-dextran, calcium phosphate, cationic polymers or lipids (lipofection). Chemical methods of transfection take advantage of the well-defined chemistry of nucleic acids to either generate a precipitate that host cells will take up or that can be encouraged to fuse with and cross the cell membrane. These techniques are usually inexpensive, efficient and versatile. Their limitations come in the form of sensitivity to parameters such as pH and possible inconsistencies between reagents. Hybrid transfection methods Finally, there are hybrid or particle-based methods such as magnetofection or biolistic transfection. Magnetofection, uses a magnetic force to drive nanoparticles that have been associated with the exogenous nucleic acids into the host cell. This is rapid and has a high efficiency, yet remains a relatively new technology that requires adherent or immobilized cells. Biolistic particle transfection is similar but instead of a magnetic force, it fires nucleic acid-coated micro-particles at a high velocity through the host cell membranes. Regardless of the technique used, there are still a number of points to consider when attempting to transfect cells with either DNA or RNA. Purity, cell viability and protocol optimization all need to be controlled in order to maximize the transfection efficiency. + Read more - Read less Payment Methods Follow us Logistics Partners Lipocalyx International More Information about distributors Address Lipocalyx GmbH Weinbergweg 23 06120 Halle (Saale) Germany +49 345 555 98 36 +49 345 555 98 46 info@lipocalyx.de Imprint Payment Methods Shipping   Charges Terms   Conditions Privacy Policy Contact",2-10,8.0,seed,1K,2011.0,False,False,False,0.5,0.5,operational,2022-06-26 03:59:22,2016-08-08 10:16:48,,0,2020-09-30 14:19:18,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Sesam,service_provider,"WHY?
We are experienced and committed data enthusiasts. From our point-of-view it is essential that a business possesses high quality data that they can use independent of others. Data must be put to use. Data must be protected. That is why we help businesses with what we call “democratizing data” – acquiring them access to their own data, in an adequate quality, as well as gaining the control of the data that their users – and legislators – demand.  

HOW?
Sesam offers a stand-alone, generic data platform component – a master data hub that continuously exchanges data with the business’ core systems. Every update is automatically made throughout all connected systems, providing the platform with the high-quality data needed for the business’ automated solutions. The hub requires no modifications and can also be expanded gradually. This makes Sesam the most agile and effective way to make a business truly data driven. Sesam is a SaaS application, with service and support always available.  

WHAT?
Data platforms are only as good as the processed data allows them to be. Sesam delivers a unique platform component that ensures continuous optimal data quality. This makes it easier to build cost-effective, value-increasing solutions based on the platform and quickly achieve return on investment. The component is central to a business’ ability to make use of the data platform – and essentially to a business’ ability to utilize its own data and become genuinely data-driven.",11-50,37.0,early growth,3K,2014.0,False,False,False,0.0,,operational,2022-09-02 08:10:12,2019-08-13 17:16:51,827822.0,0,2022-01-17 07:55:15,2,3379,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

pritidenta GmbH,company,"Willkommen in unserer Welt!
Die Anfänge der Vollkeramik liegen über 100 Jahre zurück; um 1900 erfand ein US-amerikanischer Zahnarzt die Jacketkrone. In den 1920er Jahren wurde die Technik in Europa populär, trotz komplizierter und problembehafteter Anwendung. Als Ende der 1980er Jahre die CAD/CAM-Technologie Einzug in die Zahnheilkunde hielt, war der Grundstein für den standardmäßigen Einsatz der Vollkeramik gelegt. Heute stehen diverse Materialien zur Verfügung. Das größte Potenzial hat dabei Zirkoniumdioxid gezeigt.

Bei pritidenta dreht sich alles um diesen Werkstoff – hier liegt unsere Kernkompetenz, das ist unsere Leidenschaft. Wir machen diese eine Sache und die machen wir richtig gut.

Favourites are: insider restaurant tips, discounts for shops, info on getting into the city, and ideas for skipping queues and getting to your gate more quickly. 

Since we were founded in 2015, we're proud to have won awards and be recommended by Buzzfeed, BBC Travel, NY Times, USA Today, Guardian, Skift and more. 

We also partner with airports to help them improve the passenger experience and increase their retail footfall. We're currently proud partners of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Athens Airport, Hamburg Airport, Cologne Airport, and there are more on the way... we'll let you know when we know.

We cover over 3,000 airports, with in-depth information for the biggest 300. We also offer features to book your airport lounge, parking and fast track, and save money at restaurants, bars, cafés, duty-free shops and more with exclusive discounts.

Mit diesen Produkten erreicht der Hotelier seine Gäste mit Angeboten, Services und Informationen rund um deren Aufenthalt über verschiedene Kontaktpunkte – egal ob über Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, Fernseher oder am Frühstückstisch.

SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY Let the app run in the background so that others also find the spaces you vacate No More Parking Search. Ever. ParkTAG is an easy to use application that helps you to find free parking spots in your city. It works with an auto-detection algorithm. This means that ParkTAG detects, in real time, parking spots that are available or will become available in the near future. You´ll see upcoming spots up to 10 minutes before other drivers! Unlike other applications, ParkTAG shows curbside parking spots and not just private parking. The app works via community involvement and is free of charge for your. The more users the better it becomes. Just by opening the app you are automatically contributing to the community. Check out how ParkTAG works here! ParkTAG Cities Stockholm Berlin Copenhagen Munich Oslo Hamburg Vienna More cities coming soon... Your city is missing? Tell us where you are. Well notify you when the community grows in your city. KEEP ME UPDATED So Many Questions So, yet another parking app? ParkTAG helps you find a curbside parking space. You can see where other ParkTAG users already vacated or will vacate their parking space in a few minutes. Basically ParkTAG allows you to look into the future. This works already in the above mentioned cities. Uhmsocial parking? What does that really mean? The ParkTAG community helps each other to find parking spaces. All users let the ParkTAG app run on their phone. The app automatically detects when one parked. It will automatically detect when the car vacates again. That vacating parking space will be visible to the community. Completely anonymously! What sourcery is this, sire? We use clever algorithms that understand the sensor data from your smartphone. Thus the app detects when you are about to vacate or just vacated a parking space. The vacancy will be visible anonymously to other members of the community. That´s how you help other users to find a parking spot (and vice versa). Urg...are you tracking me? No! At no point can someone identify your position. No real-time location data is ever transmitted. The algorithm works directly on your phone. Once a parking event occurs the anonymous information is transmitted. Effectively that data package contains the coordinates of the parking space (not you!), a timestamp, an event type and an identifier for the phone (not you, again!). To improve the app you can decide to turn the Training module on. This module temporarily submits some extra sensor data to us. During the training period the algorithm operates on our server. You can find more information about data security in our Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy. If anything is unclear to you, we are happy to receive an E-mail. Grrr, the map is emptyno vacancy around me? The more drivers join the community, the more parking spots will be visible. So when there is no vacancy around you it means that you are the first parking hero in your area. Invite friends, family and neighbors to join the community. With every member you recruit, the community grows and you have an easier life finding parking. Or please contact us via Facebook, Twitter or e-mail us and we will try to find more users in your area. Woop, woop! How can I help? Install ParkTAG. Let it run in the background. Enjoy the ride. There is no need to manually repoort anything. The app detects automatically when you are about to vacate a parking space. You can help e´verybody most, if you spread the word. The more people use ParkTAG the higher the chance that someone is vacating where you are arriving. Green, gray, pins. My head is spinning... Youll find three different pins on the map: Green Pins (<10); parking spots vacating in the next 10 minutes. Green Pins (<5); parking spots vacating in less than 5 minutes. Grey Pins (<5); are recently vacated parking spaces (less than 5 minutes). Narf, got there but no parking :( Case 1: The green pins (5 or 10 minutes) are shown on the map when a vacating space is detected. Depending on the time you drove to the parking space, it is possible that the vacancy cleared before you arrived. To avoid it, we will soon introduce a system to allow a personal handover between you and other users. Case 2: The gray pins (5 minutes) are shown on the map when someone has already vacated. If the parking spaces still available or not, depends on traffic. Please use your own judgement, if its worth trying to reach this parking space. You obviously have to consider the time of day and demand for parking spaces. Dude, I am gonna sue your ***! It might be that a driver occupies a parking space without using ParkTAG. Parking spaces are public property. Most driving regulations around the world state that a driver waiting with the indicator has the right of way. So if you´re already standing at the vacant parking space with flashing indicator, its yours. But please always be respectful. The world is competitive enough already Does ParkTAG run on indestructable Nokia 3310? ParkTAG is currently available for iPhones (5 and up) and for Android phones (4.2 and up). We have a team of 3 engineers trying to open a Nokia shell since a few months. Once we have it open we might be able to estimate development time for you. Is the app really for free? Like really, really? We are financed by the Hightech Gründerfond (public-private-partnership between the German Ministry of economics and German corporates). Also the European Commission supports us through the Horizon 2020 program. Our revenues come from car manufacturers, mobility apps on other corporates who license the technology we invented. ...more questions Hello World! This is us. We were trying to find funny pictures.

LOCLET,company,"LOCLET verbindet Menschen mit Orten auf spielerische Art und Weise.  In dem ortsbasierten Quizspiel können Spieler spannende Rätsel - so genannte “Loclets” - an Orten in der Stadt lösen und selbst platzieren. LOCLET ermöglicht somit das spielerische Entdecken und Erkunden von Städten. 

Die Smartphone-App geleitet Nutzer vor Ort zu den Rätseln. Um ein Loclet zu lösen, muss man es öffnen und sich meist in kurzer Zeit nach Hinweisen in der Umgebung  umschauen. 
Nutzer können einzelne Regionen “erobern” indem sie dort möglichst viele Rätsel lösen. Auch fremde Städte können Teil des Siegeszuges werden - dank spezieller Loclets, die von überall aus geöffnet werden können. So ersetzt  LOCLET den Reiseführer vor dem nächsten Städtetrip.

Egal, ob man eine Stadt rein virtuell oder real durchkämmt, stets sammelt der Spieler wertvolle oder lustige Gegenstände, die das Spielerlebnis erweitern und neue Fähigkeiten verleihen.  Lokale Ranglisten und Herausforderungen unter Freunden führen zu einem besonderen Spielspaß und ermöglichen den direkten Vergleich im Quizwettstreit.",2-10,,seed,0.3K,2014.0,False,False,False,0.0,,operational,2022-08-25 03:22:50,2019-11-25 11:32:05,,0,2019-11-26 01:30:57,2,226,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

CryoTherapeutics,company,"CryoTherapeutics GmbH The Heart ofArtery Rehabilitation Home News Contact Cardiovascular disease is the biggest killer in the Western world. The development of novel interventional treatment strategies, such as thrombolysis, angioplasty and stenting, has had a significant impact in reducing mortality from heart attacks and the market for interventional cardiac devices is estimated at $8 billion in 2005. CryoTherapeutics is focusing on the development, demonstration of clinical benefit, and early-stage commercialization of a proprietary cryotherapy system for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease that causes heart attacks. The safety and efficacy of cryoenergy in the cardiovascular system has been demonstrated and CryoTherapeutics intends to extend the benefits of cryoenergy to the problem of diseased coronary arteries. The Problem In the United States alone over half a million people die annually from a heart attack. While stents and other interventional therapies are effective in treating stable stenotic lesions they are not intended to treat unstable non-stenotic lesions. Studies have estimated that the majority of heart attacks are caused by non-significantly stenosed arteries that rupture without any warning. While non-occlusive in nature, unstable coronary plaque may ultimately lead to occlusion of the coronary artery following erosion of the fibrous cap. Removal of this cap exposes the fatty plaque, which triggers blood clot formation. It is these clots that occlude the coronary artery and lead to a sudden heart attack. The Market CryoTherapeutics is initially targeting the existing heart attack treatment market. Heart attack patients are those already undergoing a procedure for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and therefore do not require any third party diagnostics to identify their unstable plaque. Treatment can be applied based on the identification of systemic and/or local markers that exist today, together with angiography to guide cryotherapy. CryoTherapeutics estimates the market represents an existing unmet need worth more than $1 billion annually. It is predicted that within the next decade several million people worldwide will undergo some form of coronary diagnosis and of these; the majority will be diagnosed with a low-grade (less than 70%) stenosis and would be candidates for a therapeutic procedure related to non-critical plaque. Longer term The Company estimates the worldwide market of patients that could benefit from a coronary cryostabilization therapy for prevention of heart attack is estimated at in excess of $6 billion. Technology/IP Cryotherapy has been used in the cardiovascular system for more than 40 years for treatments of arrhythmias and more recently peripheral vascular disease. The initial work leading to the formation of CryoTherapeutics led to the development key issued patents in the area of cryotherapy devices for treatment of arterial disease. Additional patents are in the filing process. Competition The market potential for coronary plaque treatment has attracted a number of companies with technologies ranging from pharmaceuticals to local phototherapy to drug-eluting stents. Although pharmaceutical approaches, such as statin drugs, have shown to play a valuable role, CryoTherapeutics expects interventional cardiologists will prefer a systemic drug based approach in combination with a localised device-based therapy. Future competition is expected from technologies such as biodegradable stents and drug eluting balloons. However these approaches are not addressing the same potential market as CryoTherapeutics, their focus being on replacing stents in treatment of severe lesions and restenosis.",2-10,9.0,seed,0.2K,2009.0,False,False,True,31.0,12.3,operational,2022-08-22 20:22:36,2013-10-01 11:00:00,,0,2022-02-18 10:00:24,2,180,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Rejected

Saralon’s technology to simplify Printed Electronics
Keeping the need of color printing companies in mind, Saralon has simplified the complete production process of Printed Electronics, which is called InkTech. InkTech is a combination of inks and production technologies for Printed Electronics. Apart from selling inks, Saralon provides complete production know-hows for ready-to-use applications. These process know-hows are explained below.

Printing process
In traditional color printing, multiple color layers are printed with almost similar thicknesses. But in Printed Electronics, different layers are printed with different thicknesses, ranging from few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Saralon has solved and simplified all these issues to transfer the know-hows to printing companies through an onsite training.

Integration process
In order to create an application based on Printed Electronics, the integration of graphics printed objects with electronics must be done in a cost-effective way. Saralon, with its long expertise in the field of integration techniques, provides full support to printing companies to develop ready-to-use applications.

Smacc,company,"SMACC - Automatisiertes Finanzwesen durch Künstliche Intelligenz


Buchhaltung ist für jedes Unternehmen essentiell. Aus diesem Grund hat SMACC eine Lösung für Unternehmen entwickelt, die automatisierte Buchhaltung durch Künstliche Intelligenz ermöglicht. 

In unserem Kontext bedeutet Künstliche Intelligenz, die Fähigkeit eines Software-Programms aus bekannten Regeln zu lernen (zu generalisieren) und das Gelernte ohne menschliche Unterstützung auf neue Sachverhalte anzuwenden. Die Technologie, die das ermöglicht, basiert auf künstlichen neuronalen Netzen, die auch bei selbstfahrenden Autos und in der Krebsfrüherkennung angewandt werden. Mit dieser Technik können Tätigkeiten der Buchhaltung wie z.B. das Erfassen von Rechnungsinformationen, Kontierungen oder auch der Bankabgleich automatisiert werden und ermöglichen so maximale Effizienz.

Seit der Gründung im Jahr 2015, ist das komplementäre und internationale Team schnell gewachsen und vereint nun mehr als 60 clevere Informatiker, Wirtschaftsfachleute und Buchhalter. Die Gründer, Dr. Ulrich Erxleben und Janosch Novak, sind erfolgreiche Entrepreneurs und haben zuvor bei renommierten Unternehmen wie McKinsey, der Deutschen Bank und Rocket Internet gearbeitet.

Als junges Unternehmen mit starker Finanzierung verbindet Omnea das Beste aus zwei Welten: Zum einen sind wir ein innovatives Start-Up ohne verkrustete Strukturen, in dem Du noch viel bewegen und aufbauen kannst; zum anderen sind wir mit starken Investoren im Rücken so solide finanziert, dass unser Wachstum auch über mehrere Jahre gesichert ist.

Über unsere Dienstleistung:

Ein Handwerker, Arzt, Ladenbesitzer, Autohändler oder auch Filialisten etc. sind oft völlig damit überfordert, ihre Online-Präsenz in den 30-40 relevanten Verzeichnis-Seiten selbst aufzubauen und aktiv zu managen. Dank intelligenter  API-Datensynchronisation kann Omnea einen vergleichbaren Service viel günstiger und besser anbieten und baut hierfür ein dynamisches Team in Berlin-Mitte auf. In den USA feiern ähnliche Anbieter mit diesem in Deutschland noch komplett neuen Modell schon große Erfolge und zeigen auch technisch auf, wohin die Reise gehen kann.

TV SMILES,company,"TVSMILES is on a mission to get the most out of advertisements and turn viewers into customers again.

Instead of simply showing ungainly ads that aren’t adapted to mobile, TVSMILES stages ads as a trivia game and rewards users for engaging with Smiles, the official in-app currency. The users can then redeem the Smiles for cool products and vouchers.

The concept has been warmly accepted by its users – success by facts:

• More than two million registrations in Germany & the UK
• More than 150,000 5 star ratings
• 20 million video views per month
• 400 million ad impressions per month
• National awards: made-in-de award (22nd May 2014), Gruenderszene award (6th August 2014) and the   webinale award (9th June 2015)

TVSMILES is a fast and direct advertising channel to reach Generation Y’s who are more and more withdrawing from classic advertising. The TVSMILES user is a mobile-first user. Not to mention the fact that ad blockers usually shield this target group. Generation Y’s simply ask the question: “What’s in it for me?” and here is the answer: With gamification and an appealing rewards program, TVSMILES brings advertisements back to this user.

CorTec,company,"CorTec - Thinking ahead

CorTec is a young company in the field of medical engineering. We are developing the world’s most efficient implants serving as a direct interface between brain and technology.

CorTec Brain Interchange is an new brain pacemaker technology  that we are offering to our customers for the treatment of neurological diseases. The completely implantable system is able to record brain activity and influence it by electrical stimulation.

The unique feature of CorTec Brain Interchange is that it is able to control itself (closed-loop technology): The system records the brain’s activity and thus the effect of its stimulation. It then aligns its further activities with the recorded data.

Neurotechnological implants currently available on the market work via externally controlled continuous stimulation of the brain. CorTec Brain Interchange determines the respective therapeutic demand in direct communication with the brain and thus allows for more gentle treatment.

As a technology platform CorTec Brain Interchange is open to many fields of application in therapy, rehabilitation or assistive technology.

We are already serving a growing circle of prestigious international customers in industry and research that are mostly using our proprietary °AirRay electrode.

Karosso,company,"Karosso is the first scalable two-sided marketplace that fixes all the pain points of buying and selling used 
cars. Sellers get more and buyers pay less for the same services as at the local car dealer due to 
centralization and savings in overheads.

Company vision
Our vision is to simplify the way pre-owned cars are bought and sold for a new generation of consumers. 

Team
Johannes Stoffel, Victor Thoma and Sebastian Specht are three EBS University graduates and founded 
the company in January 2015. They are now ready to roll out in Germany.

Detailed description
For sellers, we check their cars for technical and optical issues while offering them a better price than the 
local car dealer. Buyers can buy certified cars online, being delivered to their homes with a one year 
warranty on top. We erase all the pain points of existing platforms due to quality check, fixed prices, free 
delivery, and handling all the paperwork. It has never been easier before to buy and sell your car. Join the 
used car market place of the 21st century.

Why now? 
The internet has changed several industries over the years. However, the process of buying and selling 
cars has not changed for decades. Karosso takes all the hassle of buying and selling used cars out of the 
system. Rather than getting ripped off by a dealership or having to deal with the hassle of selling via 
existing online marketplaces, Karosso helps sellers make more money by listing their cars on its 
marketplace and taking a small portion of the sale. Meanwhile buyers get peace of mind due to the 
extensive inspection process Karosso does in collaboration with DEKRA for all vehicles before they are 
listed.

What problems does this product solve?
Dealer cost money both for sellers and buyers, intransparent information of the car and price, buying and 
selling cars cost time, the fear of shady people.

SEMKNOX,company,"Das Problem
Das Internet ist voll von Produkten jeglicher Kategorien und stellt den Endkunden vor die Qual der Wahl: Welches Produkt ist sein Geld wert und dazu noch das Richtige für ihn? Der Endkunde wird gezwungen, sich aufwändig über die gewünschten Eigenschaften seines anvisierten Produktes zu informieren, was ihn von den Angebotsseiten eines Webshops wegleitet zu Blogeinträgen, Foren oder Fach-Webseiten.

Die Lösung
SEMKNOX hat eine semantische Produktsuche entwickelt, welche die in Umgangssprache formulierten Kundenwünsche beantworten kann. Anfragen wie „Suche aktuelle Digitalkamera für Unterwasseraufnahmen mit viel Speicherplatz“ oder „Notebook mit hochwertigen Lautsprechern und Bluray-Player“ können sehr präzise verstanden werden. Auch sog. „weiche Anfragen“ wie „Bildschirm für Fotografen“ oder „Stylisches Handy mit toller Fotofunktion“, deren Beantwortung unabhängig von technischen Spezifikationen sind, kann die semantische Produktsuche von SEMKNOX auflösen. Weiterhin werden Rechtsschreibfehler korrigiert, verlässlich die angefragte Produktkategorie erkannt und auch spezifische Anfragen nach einzelnen Produkten beantwortet.

Die Zielgruppe
Die semantische Produktsuche richtet sich an Webshops und Preisvergleichsportale. Durch die Vereinfachung der Produktsuche kann SEMKNOX seinen Kunden helfen, ihre Bounce Rate zu verringern, die Conversion Rate zu steigern und den Warenkorb-Wert zu erhöhen, was erweiterten Umsatz und Gewinn bedeutet.

Wettbewerbsvorteil und Alleinstellungsmerkmal
Alle von uns untersuchten Technologien der Mitbewerber erreichen nicht die Präzision der SEMKNOX-Technologie. Anders als die Konkurrenz sucht SEMKNOX nicht einfach nur mit den Eingaben des Endkunden in den Beschreibungstexten der Produkte, sondern versteht die in der Anfrage gestellten Wünsche durch Methoden des Natural Language Processings, verarbeitet diese mit einer Ontologie und erzeugt daraus sehr präzise Ergebnislisten.

What's more, we strive to operate as sustainably as possible. Our coffee carries BIO and Fair Trade labels, we try (wherever possible) to replace business trips with video conferences, and we make sure to use sustainable furniture, equipment and eco-electricity in our office. To give our children a chance to live in harmony with nature, we have to rethink how we live today.

We'll reward you with Bonets every time you opt for a sustainable product or provider.

Wir sind ein Darmstädter Cybersecurity-Startup und bewegen uns im spannenden Bereich Digitaler Identitäten. Aktuell bieten wir die disruptivste Online-Identifizierung für Finanzdienstleister, Versicherer, Telekommunikationsanbieter, eGovernment und eCommerce.

Bereits im Jahr 2013 forschten unsere Gründer an der Hochschule Darmstadt in den Bereichen sichere Kommunikation, Verschlüsselung und Identifizierung im digitalen Raum. Die Unterstützung durch das Gründerprogramm EXIST-Forschungstransfer, verliehen durch das BMWi, ermöglichte uns den Transfer von der Forschung in die Wirtschaft und die Gründung der AUTHADA GmbH im Mai 2015.

Mit AUTHADA wird das Smartphone zum Lesegerät für den Personalausweis – eine Revolution für bestehende Identifizierungsverfahren. Die mobile, schnelle und sichere Legitimierung erfolgt durch die NFC-Schnittstelle am Smartphone. Dadurch können potentielle Kunden eine Identifizierung bequem mit eID und PIN überall und rund um die Uhr durchführen – die elektronische Identität des Personalausweises (eID) wird in zehn Sekunden und durch das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik zertifiziert, übermittelt.

Persönliche Daten sind zu jeder Zeit verschlüsselt – auch für AUTHADA – und werden direkt nach der Übertragung gelöscht.

It respects the natural blood flow and does not require aortic bypass surgery. It is the first miniaturized device - barely 10 cm in size - that is adjustable to patients' needs, like a pacemaker to treat patients with varying degrees of severity. It has no external driveline as it is recharged via a wireless transcutaneous energy transfer system (TET). The device is implanted using a minimally invasive beating-heart procedure, commonly performed by cardiac surgeons, and lasts on average 90 minutes. 

Heart Failure (HF) is the second leading cause of death in the US and in Europe. It is a disease with high mortality rates, and repeated and extended hospitalizations.  One out of every five patients die within the year following diagnosis. The average annual cost for the hospital to follow patients is up to €77K with 70% of the cost linked to hospitalization.

FineHeart was founded by a team of internationally renowned cardiologists and managers from the Medtech Industry, led by Arnaud Mascarell (CEO), Dr. Stéphane Garrigue (CSO) and Dr. Philippe Ritter, co-inventor of cardiac resynchronization therapy. Their vision became the FineHeart's mission: developing and offering to patients a miniaturized, fully implantable, pulsatile circulatory support system that would overcome many of the challenges associated with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) currently on market.

4scotty,company,"4SCOTTY.COM - BRINGING SOFTWARE & IT TALENT IN JOBS THEY DESERVE AND DESIRE 


OUR MISSION

Create an international career platform which helps tech experts in getting a new job with minimum effort and which makes IT recruiting for companies as straightforward as possible. 


THE PLATTFORM

4scotty.com is Germany's first reverse application marketplace for specialists in software development and IT. We turn the tables and break with recruiting traditions. On 4scotty companies apply to talents with direct invites to a job interview. This dramatically shortens the process of getting to know each other. 

The heart of our platform is our matching engine based on data and machine learning. Talents only get suitable job offers to their wishes and experiences proposed. Companies only recommended candidates that match their requirements. No spam anymore! That saves much time on both sides. 

Software Developers, DevOps Experts, Product and Project Managers, IT Consultants and UI Experts can be directly invited by companies hiring. All details about the open job are already on the table before getting to know each other personally. No meaningless job interviews anymore.  


FOR TALENTS

4scotty brings light in the jungle of boring job ads, stops annoying job offer spam in social networks, and delivers an excellent personal service throughout the entire journey.


FOR COMPANIES

4scotty combines all the best of active sourcing, job ads, recruiting service, and employer branding on one platform.

ezeep,company,"The future of printing is ezeep. With ezeep, printing is dramatically simplified, enabling any device to print to any printer – whether with the ezeep printer driver from PC or Mac, via app for smartphones and tablets or even by web-based drag & drop for the occasional user.

Consumers print unlimited and – naturally – free-of-charge to their own printers and, depending on the provider, free or at a cost to external printers. This makes printing as easy as making a phone call, eliminating the need for any user support.

Companies can lower the infrastructure demands on their printer setups in branch offices worldwide, thanks to ezeep, drastically simplifying their administration. With this, the total costs for deploying printers is significantly reduced.

Coworking spaces, universities, exhibition grounds, train stations, airports and kiosks can not only make their printers publicly available with just a single click, but also charge for printing with ease. The same applies to private users or cafés which want to share their printers with others. Printers are thereby transformed into sources of income, not costs.

Open interfaces enable integrations with existing solutions, such as for user and resource management, cost control or compliance monitoring for maximum cost savings via automation. A constantly growing ecosystem of standard integrations by development partners makes these benefits also available to non-technical users.

By reducing costs and removing all technical requirements, whilst providing the ability to use third-party printers at any time, ezeep ensures that in the future people will be able to print from almost every location quickly and easily, for whatever reason they might have.

ezeep is committed to minimizing the CO2 footprint of printing and ensuring that printed paper can be a meaningful, productive and responsible alt
